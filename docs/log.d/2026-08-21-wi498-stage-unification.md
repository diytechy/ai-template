## 2026-08-21 — WI-498, the stage unification program: per-slice record

The owner's directive (2026-08-21): roll through the ruled plan's slices
0–5 in series (opus for the design-bearing slices, sonnet where
mechanical), each slice ending green at the commit bar. Spec-of-record:
[../plans/2026-08-21-stage-unification-plan.md](../plans/2026-08-21-stage-unification-plan.md)
(v1 FINAL); the OI-51 ruling is its authority. One section per slice as it
lands; adjacent findings accumulate at the bottom.

Deferred open items: none yet — declarations accumulate per section; this
top-matter line is re-derived at each close.

### Slice 0 — one enum home (opus worker) — LANDED

The eight-rung `DevStg-*` ladder moved to **`project-trajectory/scripts/kitlib/ladder.py`**:
the rung labels, `STAGE_ORDER`, the derived `STAGE_OF`, `STAGE_DESC`,
`LADDER_RUNGS`, and `stage_ord`. `derive_gate` re-exports every name under its
former spelling (six modules and the suite already read `derive_gate.STAGE_*`;
re-pointing every citation is churn this slice does not need), `agent_common`'s
`LADDER_RUNGS` literal and `traj_status`'s `_STAGE_LABELS` bind to the shared
objects. No derived value moved: `docs/gate`'s `# basis:` line is unchanged
except for the row counts the mint below adds.

**Why `ladder` and not `stage`.** It is the word the repo already uses for this
table (`LADDER_RUNGS`, `tests/test_stage_ladder.py`, process.md §4 "The stage
ladder"), so no new term enters the lexicon; it leaves `stage` free for slice
1's derivation-and-reader module (plan §2 names "the kitlib stage module" for
the declared input set, the fingerprint and the common reader), keeping pure
vocabulary strictly below the thing that derives over it; and `stage.py` beside
`station.py` is a confusable pair a package this small should not create. The
module imports **nothing at all**, not even stdlib — the strongest form of the
kitlib import-discipline rule, asserted from its own AST.

**Pins retired, and the warrant.** `tests/test_ratification_level.py`'s
`assert ac.LADDER_RUNGS == set(dg.STAGE_ORDER)` is gone: both names now resolve
to one object, so "the copies agree" cannot fail, and a test asserting a
frozenset equals itself is vacuous rather than weak. Replaced by identity
assertions (`is`) — the WI-448 precedent verbatim (`tests/test_rule_sync.py`,
"the declared-line reader: WAS 5-way, now ONE home"). The `DIAL_HOLDS`
containment half survives: it is a hand-authored mapping, not a copy.

**A FIFTH definition home the design-record §3 inventory missed**, found while
executing: `traj_status._STAGE_LABELS` was a byte-identical copy of `STAGE_DESC`
pinned by **nothing**. Worse place than the pinned ones — a reworded or inserted
rung would have shown the dashboard the old sentence, or dropped the stage
bullet entirely (`stage in _STAGE_LABELS` degrades to bar-only wording), with
every test green. It now imports `kitlib.ladder` **directly**, not through
`derive_gate`: a render leaf should not load a 1,400-line derivation engine for
eight strings (the WI-483 `station` direction).

**`check_vocab` needed no change** — a deviation from the slice brief, which
expected restatements there. Inspected: its only `DevStg-*` occurrences are the
`ALIAS`/`GATE_ALIASES` tables mapping *retired* spellings to current ones
(migration shims, explicitly in scope to keep) and prose. It restates no live
enum, so there was nothing to import.

**Spine mint, and it drags no bar.** `check_trajectory --strict` refused the new
module as owned by no component. Minimal honest resolution was a Drafted mint,
not an amendment: appending `ladder.py` to LLR-181's cell would have put it
under the four-way usage tag LLR-182 explicitly refuses (it suppresses the
cross-component seam rule on the new edges), and LLR-157 — the row that owns the
stage axis — is **Approved** and not a worker's to touch. So **LLR-184**
(single tag `CMP-006`, the component that decides the stage's meaning; a
consumer reading a table does not own it) + **TC-179**, watermark bumped by
`trace.py --bump-ids` (LLR 183→184, TC 178→179). Evidence it dragged nothing:
the gate read `computed=DevStg-Below … phase=5 per-phase=…5=DevStg-Below
stage=DevStg-Reqs` before the mint and reads the same after — phase 5 was
already floored by 9 existing drafts.

**Scaffold-verified, per the standing lesson.** Bootstrapped a real scaffold and
ran the shipped scripts in it: `kitlib/ladder.py` arrives; `derive_gate` writes
`stage=DevStg-Needs stage-ord=0 stage-of=8`; `check_vocab` clean; `trace` clean;
`agent_common.human_holds` resolves the rung set (and still holds an unknown
rung — the conservative direction); `traj_status._stage_line` renders
"stage 3 of 8, architecture (partition) in work" from the shared table.

**Ratchets re-stamped deliberately.** `bootstrap.py` 2920→2926 (the MAPPING row
+ its reason comment; a manifest growing). `agent_common.py` 2414→2412
(re-stamped DOWN). `derive_gate.py` **entry deleted** — it fell 1531→1424, below
the 1500 threshold, exactly as its own note predicted ("a re-stamp downward if
the stage-axis half is ever extracted"); a tombstone comment records why.
Smoke membership 1306→1315 for the six new in-process tests (measured 1307).
**The 60 s seconds budget was NOT moved** — see the breach note below.

Adopter-facing: RESYNC_PACK entry `kitlib/ladder.py — the eight-rung stage
vocabulary gets one home [since f23e6002]`, plus the kit-contents README row and
the package docstring's themed-module list.

Gates, real output on this box:

- `python -m pytest -q -n auto` (full, unfiltered) → **2755 passed, 14 skipped
  in 592.38 s**. The run BEFORE this one is worth recording rather than
  overwriting: **2753 passed, 14 skipped, 2 failed in 597.76 s**, and both
  failures were mine and both were the guards doing their job — the smoke
  membership ratchet (re-stamped above) and `check_vocab` refusing the retired
  `G*` tags my new test quotes as INPUTS. The second was fixed by marking the
  offending lines `check_vocab: allow`, which is that check's documented escape
  for a line that must name the retired vocabulary, not a sanction: the tags
  are the arguments `stage_ord` is being proven to reject.
- `python -m pytest -q -n auto -m smoke` → **1302 passed, 5 skipped in
  72.84 s** (on the final tree; an earlier mid-slice run read 1296 / 86.04 s).
- `python project-trajectory/scripts/check_docs.py --root . --stale` → **OK —
  978 doc(s), 1350 intra-repo link(s), 0 broken (1 orphan warning)**.
- `python project-trajectory/scripts/check_trajectory.py --root . --strict` →
  **clean (495 work item(s), 461 done (93%), 21 cancelled, graph acyclic)**.
- `python project-trajectory/scripts/trace.py --root . --strict-integrity` →
  see the close line below.
- `python project-trajectory/scripts/check_vocab.py --root . --strict` →
  **clean (455 live authored file(s); no retired gate tags)**.

**Smoke wall-clock breach, reported not absorbed:** 72.8 s (and 86.0 s on the
mid-slice run) against the declared 60 s. CLAUDE.md already records 54.9 / 64.0
/ 55.7 s on this box on 2026-08-20, so the tier was already at the ceiling
before this slice; one box is one data point and the budget is not moved to fit
it. OI-52's execution row owns that decision.

Deferred open items: none — the component-ownership question this slice brushed
is already OI-48 (ruled (d), execution queued as WI-494), and the smoke wall
clock is already OI-52's; neither is a new decision owed.

### Adjacent findings accumulating for the program close

_(per-slice sections are inserted ABOVE this section, in land order;
banked findings accumulate below as list items)_

- **The design-record §3 enum inventory was incomplete** (slice 0). It listed
  four definition homes plus the crossing table and the alias shim; it missed
  `traj_status._STAGE_LABELS`, an unpinned byte-identical copy of `STAGE_DESC`.
  The census that produced §3 evidently keyed on the CONSTANT NAMES rather than
  on the values, so a copy under a private name was invisible to it. Slices 2-5
  should assume the same blind spot for the bar axis: grep the VALUES
  (`"DevStg-`), not `BAR_`/`STAGE_`.
- **`kitlib/ladder` joins the pre-existing "connectivity undeclared" class**
  (slice 0): `check_trajectory --strict` WARNs that no `IF-###` row names it —
  the same advisory `kitlib/config`, `kitlib/git` and `kitlib/registry` already
  carry, while `kitlib/station` has IF-093 because WI-483 declared its
  cross-component seam. The ladder's consumer edges (`agent_common`,
  `traj_status`) cross components under its single `CMP-006` tag and are
  policed-but-undeclared. Declaring them is IF-minting, well outside slice 0;
  the natural home is WI-494 (OI-48 (d), the kernel's one owning component),
  which should decide the seam rows for the whole package at once rather than
  per-module.
- **`derive_gate` is now under the module-size threshold** (1424 < 1500) for the
  first time, with the bar axis still inside it. Slice 2 deletes that axis, so
  the module will fall further — worth a deliberate look at whether what remains
  is still one coherent module or wants the `stage`/`bar` split the plan
  implies.
