## Deliverable

Unified exact-publication recognition for completion and governing review identity; reset remains refresh-only. Preserved refusal on wrong candidate, turn, effects, receipt and author. Evidence, measured checks, obligation mapping and independent source review are recorded in docs/reviews/wi612-authoring/. Supervised execution under the existing pause without an ordinary claim; this records source/proof completion, not semantic acceptance or interface approval. No batch implementation/test deletion, coordinator/control window, push or main merge.

## Context

Implementation prerequisite discovered by WI-614 actual pending-primary tests while executing the WI-612 RETURN. Successful real publication and derived completion currently leave the shared verdict identity at the final tree, losing the governing candidate and its served phases. Reuse the existing exact publication verifier for read-only carrier recognition; do not add a second approval definition or let the destructive reset peel remove a primary publication. Preserve exact candidate/turn/Approval/projection and session provenance, failure toward more review, raw identity and ordinary-lane behavior. Add adversarial tests for false or mutated carriers and record actual crash-boundary proof gaps separately without relabelling hook failures as process kills. This is supervised root-cause repair, not semantic acceptance or batch deletion. Done when the WI-614 primary-path regressions and existing publication/verdict suites pass, independent source review and full/commit/strict checks pass, and the complete-scope reanchor explicitly depends on this completion. Keep pause; no control window, push or main merge.
