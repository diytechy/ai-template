## Deliverable

Already adjudicated in the range this row was minted from, so no second sitting is held (the re-mint trap, S11 plan §4.2; owner-agreed close, 2026-10-03). WI-838's in-lane adjudicator, through the retained session, returned LLR-270 (`docs/reviews/wi-838-first-mint-takes-a-lease/001-ADJUDICATE-1e1e27c.md`), then ruled the answered text MEANING and blessed it (`002-ADJUDICATE-6fd4e8b.md`, act seq 42), and approved TC-329 (`003-ADJUDICATE-6e89a27.md`, act seq 43). The low-level, system and test-case registries are byte-identical to their anchors under `docs/archive/last_approved/` at the landing.

## Context

Derived from `staged_spine_amendments` on the merged commit (§A5.2).
Approved and ROUTED traced cells only; other traced cells are silent
by ruling. Each line: registry row / cell: before -> after.

- LLR-270 `Detail`: 'CONFIG. keep_config reads [adjudicator] (context_reset_pct 0..100, retain_for, keepwarm_minutes, reset_on_same_artifact…' -> 'CONFIG. keep_config reads [adjudicator] (context_reset_pct 0..100, retain_for, keepwarm_minutes, reset_on_same_artifact…'

Outcomes (§A5.2): re-attest the rows ruled CLARITY (and, where the
dial releases the rung, the MEANING rows you would bless) by naming
them in the act's `--reattests`; on a HUMAN-HELD tier a CLARITY row
is re-attested naming its `--verdict` and a MEANING row is
recommended to the owner (ruled decision 2 as OI-100 amends it). Or
draft the real scope-change / re-scope / cancellation rows in a
`## Dispositions` section of THIS spec — intake mints them at this
row's merge (drafts-not-mints, R1).
