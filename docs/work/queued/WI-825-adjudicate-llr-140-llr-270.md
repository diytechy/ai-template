## Context

Derived from `staged_spine_amendments` on the merged commit (§A5.2).
Approved and ROUTED traced cells only; other traced cells are silent
by ruling. Each line: registry row / cell: before -> after.

- LLR-140 `Detail`: 'claim: §2.3 steps 1+2 with the refusal ladder, cheapest first (tracked pause via agent_common.tracked_pause; an existin…' -> 'claim: when the coordinator context guard is enabled and the claim does not hold the dispatch lock (the live dispatcher…'
- LLR-270 `Detail`: 'CONFIG. keep_config reads [adjudicator] (context_reset_pct 0..100, retain_for, keepwarm_minutes, reset_on_same_artifact…' -> 'CONFIG. keep_config reads [adjudicator] (context_reset_pct 0..100, retain_for, keepwarm_minutes, reset_on_same_artifact…'

Outcomes (§A5.2): re-attest the rows ruled CLARITY (and, where the
dial releases the rung, the MEANING rows you would bless) by naming
them in the act's `--reattests`; on a HUMAN-HELD tier a CLARITY row
is re-attested naming its `--verdict` and a MEANING row is
recommended to the owner (ruled decision 2 as OI-100 amends it). Or
draft the real scope-change / re-scope / cancellation rows in a
`## Dispositions` section of THIS spec — intake mints them at this
row's merge (drafts-not-mints, R1).
