## Context

Derived from `staged_drafted_rows` on the merged commit (§A5.2).
These spine rows are BELOW approval and no act has blessed them.
Each line: registry row / what the lane did.

- LLR-210 authored in `docs/requirements/low-level-requirements.toml`
- TC-208 authored in `docs/test/test-cases.toml`

Outcomes (owner ruling 2026-09-01): read each row's WHOLE CHAIN — the
parent SR, the sibling LLRs, the test cases — and either APPROVE (move
the rows' `Status` to `Approved` and take the anchoring snapshot,
`python scripts/intake.py snapshot --approves "<REGISTRY>=<this row>"`,
in ONE reviewed commit on this lane) or RETURN with findings, drafting
the follow-up in a `## Dispositions` section of THIS spec — intake mints
it at this row's merge (drafts-not-mints, R1). The approval act is
YOURS: a work lane's merge is refused if it performs one.
