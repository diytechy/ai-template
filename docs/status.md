Contracts: IF-163 — the interface seam this file declares (process.md §8; row of
record in requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-163: the forward-only blackboard's HAND-AUTHORED bytes — everything
    outside the GENERATED STATUS marker pair — read as data by the kit's checks
    and by a resuming session; the block between the markers is its writer's
    own row. Markdown with `##` sections: `## Current State` is the section a
    stopping coordinator excerpts into its exit banner (the generated block
    rides inside that excerpt as the writer's bytes). Only what must happen
    NEXT belongs here — what already happened lives in log.md — so a work-item
    id recorded closed must not appear in the hand-authored prose, and a claim
    naming one there is refused; inside the generated block that rule stands
    down, because the generated frontier legitimately names queued ids.

# Meta-Repo Status — Blackboard

The **working surface** for developing the kit itself. **Forward-only**, held to
the declared S-1 budget (`docs/status-lint`; raised 2026-08-31 to carry the
supervisor prompt at the owner's request). Backward-looking homes:
[log.md](log.md) (sessions, verdicts, **Decisions**), [open-items.html](open-items.html)
(the generated **Open items** owner surface), [docs/work/](work/) (the WI registry —
status = directory; terminal rows under [archive/work/](archive/work/)),
[archive/](archive/README.md), and the folder map [docs/README.md](README.md).

- **RESUME HERE:** start with the coordinator's
  [handoff-2026-10-03-wave8-coordinator.md](handoff-2026-10-03-wave8-coordinator.md)
  (new roles from 2026-10-03: Claude Opus builds at medium effort, Codex Luna
  reviews at high), then apply the owner's 2026-09-30/10-02 directions below
  (each is also noted in its WI row; the 2026-10-02 rulings are in WI-541 and
  WI-697; the assumption ruling is cited in the validation plan's 2026-10-03
  supersession note). Order:
  1. One combined sitting over WI-775 and WI-776; WI-697 (TC-279's first
     judgement: round 2's draw and readers are ready outside the repo); WI-777
     (TC-055 re-judge, after WI-775); then WI-771 (the evidence ladder), after
     that sitting acts.
  2. WI-688 second to last; its judge sitting is WI-541's multi-step occupancy
     run, and WI-541 closes with it. WI-625 (deferred) last.
  - **WI-684:** re-sync `C:\Projects\FileBackup` (stamp `9b697cc`) as a
    scratch trial, after amending TC-036's inputs to add `RESYNC_PACK.md`.
    **Not worked in the 2026-10-02 session:** the owner starts it on
    2026-10-03 (US Central).

  `docs/work/pause` is still tracked (since 2026-09-04): the unattended
  dispatcher claims nothing until a reviewed commit deletes it, so work is
  taken by a coordinator session, not the loop. The roles (owner, 2026-10-03): Claude Opus builds at medium
  effort and the coordinator commits for it, Codex Luna (`gpt-6-luna`)
  reviews at high effort through the CLI, and an independent Opus agent
  arbitrates, adjudicates and spot-checks. File new work into an open
  item's Context before minting a row. The reviewers' `codex exec` launch
  runs under a temporary `Bash(codex exec *)` allow rule in
  `.claude/settings.local.json` (owner, 2026-09-28): remove it when the
  queue drains. Recheck Git and the generated frontier before choosing
  work; earlier handoffs are historical context.
- **Assumption tier — C1 and C2 have landed and are approved:** the
  redrawn frame, checkpoint re-judging of observation tests, the assumption
  gate's four steps (behind `[checks] assumption_gate = false`), and C2's
  assumption and surrogate rows with every SR's bridging. The owner signed
  the assumption ruling on 2026-10-02: an assumption carries status and standing
  only, falsification is the one signal, and there is no evidence ladder, so
  C3 shrinks to the falsification route and C5 loses its evidence arm. OI-97's joint-delivery class has
  landed and is anchored.
- **Sister plan — one plan still owed:** every question in the
  [notes on spine, sessions and tests](plans/2026-09-23-owner-notes-spine-sessions-and-tests.md)
  §5 is ruled except S11, whose direction (one trunk commit per work item)
  needs its own plan before any ruling; design S9's reviewer-commit check with
  it. Hand integration already follows it (owner direction 2026-09-28): one
  squash commit per item, with lane tips kept reachable in `archive/lanes`. S7's session service has landed, writing S8's adopted OTel schema, with
  retention shipped off; its live verification is WI-541 (partly done). S6 is designed
  with the assumption tier before its C3. S14's flag-axis count and
  duplicate-detection research have both landed.
- **WI-688, when the owner releases it (held 2026-10-02):** resolve the existing SR-161 per-decomposition
  perspective-record gap and complete TC-211's normal sample. Follow the
  existing artifact adjudication route for the Drafted amendments; passing an
  Inspection does not approve its requirement. Keep the scope proportional to
  the missing obligation.
- **Control launch:** retain the tracked `docs/work/pause` while preparing
  route-complete spending bounds, including in-flight drain, against the
  [settled control ruling](ai-template-redesign-2026-09-05-codex/CONTROL-DECISION.md#owner-ruling-2026-09-06).
  Revalidate the [preflight](ai-template-redesign-2026-09-05-codex/CONTROL-PREFLIGHT.md)
  at the proposed frozen launch commit, then obtain the ruling's owner-reviewed
  pause deletion. Replacement packages follow the control's evidence decision.
- **Standing owner acts the loop will not make:** merge-to-main + push for
  `dualplan-routing-fix`, `guardrails-fable-method`, `ConcurrencyTrainRewrite`
  and this branch (`push = "human"`). `wi416-parked-handback-contract` is still
  single-copy — delete only after deciding it is not wanted. The held wi508
  branch is on origin; the queued wi508-partial-close row is the only
  sanctioned act on it (`OI-71`).
- **Standing constraints:** the depth-0 frame is **LOCKED and APPROVED** (4
  entities · 4 crossings · 3 relationships, watermark-held); owner-owed, not
  re-raised: `OI-49` (b)'s exception reads
  ([plans/2026-08-22-interface-exception-dossier.md](plans/2026-08-22-interface-exception-dossier.md)),
  `OI-61` (c) deferred, and the wording round's two banked findings
  ([reviews/2026-08-24-draft-wording-round/RESUME.md](reviews/2026-08-24-draft-wording-round/RESUME.md)).
- **Unfiled follow-ups** (topics, no ids): the stage-ladder program's deferred
  codex round; the SN-036 coverage record (re-derive — basis reads
  `uncovered=0`); the archived [2026-08-01 handoff §6](archive/history/handoff-2026-08-01.md)
  findings; the [spine-restructure-2026-08-08.md](spine-restructure-2026-08-08.md)
  residues (§7 items 2/4/5 need a destination); PROCESS.md §4's stale
  "ordinal `0`–`4`" approval dial; **owner intake 2026-09-22:** the self-test
  suite should fail fast when its dev toolchain is missing, and name the run
  menu's setup action as the fix. Today a missing pytest-xdist dies on
  `unrecognized arguments: -n`. This depends on the root launchers SN-034/SN-035
  require, which do not exist yet, and needs stepping through as a requirement
  before it is built.

## Current State

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED STATUS -->
_GENERATED by `python project-trajectory/scripts/gen_trajectory.py --status` — do not hand-edit; cite the spine registries + `docs/stage`, not this rendering (the forward-only intent below is hand-authored)._

- **In stage:** **DevStg-Impl** (stage 7 of 8, implementation in work) (per-phase `1=DevStg-Impl;3=DevStg-Impl;4=DevStg-Impl;5=DevStg-Impl;6=DevStg-Impl`, derived current **phase=6**) — the rung this repo is IN, derived over its settled spine. [`derive_stage.py`](../project-trajectory/scripts/derive_stage.py) derives it, recorded in [`docs/stage`](stage).
- **Spine:** **SN=31 SR=120 LLR=277 TC=282** (25 drafts) · 221 seams · 4 components.
- **Open items** _(pending rows of [requirements/open-items.toml](requirements/open-items.toml); each item's blast radius, options and recommendation render in [open-items.html](open-items.html), the generated owner surface):_
  - **OI-98** — The owner must perform the re-sync from 2026-10-03 and rule this item to release WI-684.
  - **OI-99** — The owner must release WI-688 when it is second to last in the queue and rule this item.
- **Ready frontier** _(dependency-ready WIs in build order — generated from the scheduler; a closed WI drops out automatically, so this list is never stale and never names a `done` id):_
  - **WI-775** — adjudicate: SR-215, TC-055
  - **WI-776** — adjudicate: LLR-296, TC-306, TC-309, TC-310
  - **WI-697** — re-judge TC-279: no result recorded [sha256:cf0861ee8f1d] at merge bcf1e9a
- **Blocked** _(owner gates; see IF-073):_
  - **WI-688** — re-judge TC-211: no result recorded [sha256:aa064ee9542c] at merge 77fb093 — [OI-99 — Owner hold until second to last](open-items.html#OI-99)
  - **WI-684** — re-judge TC-036: no result recorded [sha256:2f2f30dfba87] at merge 77fb093 — [OI-98 — Owner re-sync from 2026-10-03](open-items.html#OI-98)
<!-- END GENERATED STATUS -->

- **Bar (per commit)** and the **standing rules** (claim refusal on prose ids,
  never sanction a check to green a step, line-ending hygiene, claiming through
  the integrator): the `session-protocol` skill §2–§3. Run
  `check_trajectory.py --strict` unfiltered before claiming anything done;
  route a critique dispatch by PROVIDER, probing first.
- **Process (kit source):** [PROCESS.md](../project-trajectory/PROCESS.md) ·
  [PROCESS_OPTIONS.md](../project-trajectory/PROCESS_OPTIONS.md) · working rules
  [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) + the `session-protocol` skill · lock items
  [repo-lock.md](repo-lock.md) · external (not this repo's work): guardrails
  content in `TheColliny/FableClaudeMDForOpus`.

## Scope

- **Goal:** keep the kit **maintainable and trustworthy** — the `PROJECT-VISION:`
  tag opening [README.md](../README.md) is canonical.
- **Supported platforms:** Windows + POSIX; kit scripts stdlib-only, Python 3.11+.
- **Non-goals (self-application boundary):** no product **launch** — the kit's
  "product" is `project-trajectory/` + `tests/`; an actions-menu launcher is in
  scope, a `run.*` product launcher is not. No scaffolded `docs/process.md` (the
  masters live in `project-trajectory/`).
