"""Convert the requirement registries from their `.md` + `.csv` carriers to one
TOML carrier (OI-12), losslessly and reversibly.

WHY ONE CARRIER. The spine shipped two: stakeholder needs as markdown prose
tables, SR/LLR/TC as CSV. The split has no recorded rationale anywhere, and it
costs. Reading 32 SN rows takes ~166 code lines across 14 functions in 8
modules; reading all 436 SR+LLR+TC rows takes `csv.DictReader`. TOML is stdlib
at the kit's 3.11 floor (`tomllib`), is already sanctioned in two homes here
(`docs/process.toml`, the `+++` frontmatter of every work-item spec), and holds
the cells that ACTUALLY exist rather than the cells CSV wishes existed: the
comma-bearing cells, the ones holding a literal `|`, the 1,500-character ones,
and the embedded newline CSV cannot represent at all.

WHAT THE CARRIER BUYS THAT A CHECK USED TO. Three integrity rules stop being
code and become properties of the parse:
  * a DUPLICATE ID is a `TOMLDecodeError` — the id is the table key, and TOML
    forbids declaring one twice;
  * a REF LIST is a typed array, retiring the split-on-whitespace rule and with
    it the `SN-001 and SN-002` -> "`and` is an orphan" defect;
  * an EMPTY CELL is an ABSENT KEY, so "unset" and "set to empty" stop being
    the same string.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. Carrier only. `Status` keeps whatever
vocabulary the tree it converts already uses — `Drafted` / `Approved` /
`Founded` since D-9 steps 5/7/8 — and a value this converter does not recognize
is COPIED, never mapped. That is the rule, not an omission: a downstream tree
still carrying `Modified` (or `Draft`, or `Verified`) owes a human ruling on
each such row, and a carrier conversion that stamped them clean would launder
exactly the re-blessing they owe (repo-lock Q11). The always-on integrity floor
names them after the conversion, which is where they should be named. No anchor
cells, no `Priority` float, no `SupersededBy` deletion, no SN `Status`. Those
land once, on this carrier, in the D-3/D-4 pass.

REVERSIBILITY IS THE POINT OF `--check`. It re-reads what it wrote and asserts
the round-trip is cell-for-cell identical to the source, so a conversion that
silently drops a cell fails here rather than in a gate three commits later.

Contracts: IF-103 — the seam this module declares (process.md §8; row of record
in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Requirements: SR-147 (one machine-parseable carrier for the spine).

# The column's conventional value is `(see TC-017)` — a prose pointer, which
# check_doc_refs names as such where it declines to read a path out of it — and
# only one row of 141 holds a bare id list. Splitting prose on whitespace made
# `test_refs = ["(see", "TC-017)"]`, which re-joins as `(see; TC-017)`: a
# TEXT CHANGE to 140 design rows, smuggled into a carrier-only migration, and
# the very defect the typed array exists to retire (`SN-001 and SN-002` ->
# "`and` is an orphan") committed in the other direction. As a plain string
# every shape round-trips byte-exact and every consumer keeps the split rule it
# already applied to this cell under CSV.
#
# `WI-Refs` (open-items) JOINS THEM and `Version` (agents) DOES NOT, both by the
# same measurement the `TestRefs` paragraph above describes. Every live and
# shipped `WI-Refs` cell is empty or a bare `WI-###`, and its only consumer
# already splits it (`intake._pending_oi_lines` -> `agent_common._refs`), so the
# typed array is what the cell already meant. `Version` reads numeric — `4.8`,
# `5.6` — and is exactly the trap: as a TOML float it stops being the text the
