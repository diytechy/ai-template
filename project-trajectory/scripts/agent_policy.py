"""Declared process policy, approval authority, and coordinator dials.

This module owns the constrained ``docs/process.toml`` reading, its conflict and
shape findings, approval-rung comparisons, and the small coordinator dial
resolution built from those declarations. Coordinator locks, Git, subprocess
harnessing, assignment state, and telemetry remain in ``agent_common``.

Contracts: IF-261, IF-291 — the interface seam this file declares (process.md §8; row
of record in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-261: ``agent_common`` imports and re-exports this module's policy
readers and findings. A docs path or parsed policy is supplied; normalized dial
values, authority decisions, or explicit refusal strings are returned. The
module writes nothing and launches only the existing derived-stage fallback.

Contract IF-291: blackout_at(docs, t=None) is the single policy-reading boundary for the blackout window. It returns Blackout(window, at, end, last_end): end is the exclusive end of the interval containing at, if any; last_end is the most recent interval end at or before at.

# --- SN-029: the human-approval level, as an ORDINAL ----------------------
# THE DIAL, and why it replaces a three-value enum. `attended | single-approve |
# autonomous` answered "who approves" with three words that four independent
# tables then re-interpreted, each with its own fail-safe direction. What the
# dispatcher actually needs is an ORDINAL comparison — is the tier this row sits
# at still human-held? — and an enum cannot express "TCs are human-held but LLRs
# are not", which is the distinction the eight-rung stage ladder exists to make.
#
# THE LEGACY TRANSLATION, stated as all THREE dials rather than as a level.
# The enum's three words were never one axis: each of them bundled a tier hold,
# a drain policy and an end-of-run hold, which is precisely why four tables had
# to re-interpret the same word. Translating to a level alone loses two of the
# three facts — the shape of the original SN-029 bug, where `single-approve`
# became "level 2" and so silently acquired a per-tier hold it never had.
#
#   attended       every tier is the human's; lanes drain at an approval
#   single-approve  LLM review through DevStg-Reqs+DevStg-Tests, ONE human sitting
#                  at the close — so NO per-tier hold (level 0), a final read,
#                  and the non-dependent work kept running that distinguished it
#   autonomous     every bar but the owner's final read closes on a recorded
#                  LLM verdict

# --- THE RE-KEY (WI-493, OI-21 shape (ii), folded into WI-498 slice 5) ---------
# THE DIAL MOVED, DELIBERATELY, and the block below this one used to say the
# opposite. OI-21 ruled shape (i) — keep the 0-4 ordinal and MAP it onto the
# ladder through a declared `DIAL_HOLDS` table — and named this conversion as
# shape (ii), available to supersede (i). The owner exercised that clause; the
# stage unification is where it lands, because the reason (i) was ever needed is
# the reason it is now unnecessary.
#
# WHY THE MAPPING TABLE COULD RETIRE RATHER THAN BE RE-KEYED. `DIAL_HOLDS`
# existed to bridge TWO vocabularies: an ordinal counting approvable TIERS and a
# ladder of labelled RUNGS. Shape (i)'s own argument against the retired
# `stage < level` arithmetic was that it compared two different ladders that
# happened to line up. Under one vocabulary there is only one ladder, so the
# comparison stops being a coincidence and becomes the definition: the dial names
# the HIGHEST rung a human still approves, and every rung AT OR BELOW it is held.
# That is the exact mirror of the at-or-above rule slice 2 gave check selection.
#
# EQUIVALENCE DRIVEN BEFORE THE TABLE WAS DELETED, not asserted after: all five
# former levels hold precisely the same rung sets under the ordinal rule
# (0 -> 0 rungs, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 4, 3 -> 5, 4 -> 8). The old table's most
# hand-reasoned property — that `DevStg-Boundary` rides `DevStg-Needs` and
# `DevStg-Arch` rides `DevStg-Reqs`, chosen because it errs toward MORE human
# involvement — falls out of the ordering for free, because each inserted rung
# sits immediately above the rung it was made to ride. `tests/test_approval_
# level.py` pins the equivalence permutation by permutation.
#
# WHAT THE RE-KEY BUYS BEYOND THE VOCABULARY: three settings the ordinal could
# not express. `DevStg-Needs`, `DevStg-Reqs`, `DevStg-Tests` and `DevStg-Impl`
# are now legal dial values with obvious meanings (hold Needs but not Boundary;
# hold through Reqs but not the partition; and so on). The old dial had five
# notches for eight rungs and the three it could not name were unreachable
# rather than forbidden.
#
# "NOTHING IS HUMAN-HELD" IS `DevStg-Below`, not a fourth kind of value. It is
# the sentinel `kitlib.stage` already declares for "below every rung", used here
# in exactly that sense: set the dial below the ladder and no rung is at or below
# it. A magic word like `"none"` would have been a second vocabulary in the one
# place this program exists to remove one.

# --- OI-21 -> WI-493: THE DIAL AND THE LADDER ARE ONE VOCABULARY --------------
# THE DIAL MOVED. It was the APPROVABLE-TIER ORDINAL 0-4 SN-029 defined (0 =
# nothing held, 1 = SNs, 2 = ...and SRs, 3 = ...and LLRs, 4 = ...and TCs), mapped
# onto the eight rungs by a declared `DIAL_HOLDS` table under OI-21 shape (i).
# WI-493 executed shape (ii): it now names a `DevStg-*` rung directly, and the
# table retired because there is no longer a second vocabulary to map from. The
# full argument, the driven equivalence and what the change buys are recorded at
# the re-key block above `APPROVAL_DIAL_RUNGS`.
#
# WHAT DID *NOT* MOVE, and this is the part OI-21 was emphatic about: the dial
# still says WHICH SPINE RUNGS a human approves. It was NOT re-keyed to artifact
# DEPTH. Re-keying approval to the depth and tier of the artifact touched is a
# change to WHEN A HUMAN IS RE-ENGAGED whose wrong-answer direction is silently
# LESS human involvement, so it is decided on its own — once IF/CMP maturity
# joins the approvable fold — and never defaulted here.
#
# WHERE THE TWO INSERTED RUNGS LAND is no longer a decision this module makes.
# `DevStg-Boundary` and `DevStg-Arch` produce artifacts (IF and CMP rows) that
# are not approvable TIERS, so the old ordinal had no notch for them and the
# table had to choose: each was held whenever the rung BELOW it was held —
# Boundary rides Needs, Arch rides Reqs — chosen because it errs toward MORE
# human involvement. Under the at-or-below rule that choice falls out of the
# LADDER ORDER for free, because each inserted rung sits immediately above the
# rung it was made to ride. The hand-reasoned property became a structural one.
#
# `LADDER_RUNGS` names the whole closed vocabulary — not just the held subset —
# because "is this a rung I recognize" and "is this rung held" are different
# questions, and `human_holds` must answer the first CONSERVATIVELY. Without it
# an unrecognized label (`""`, a typo, a rung from a newer kit) would compare as
# an ordinal lookup failure rather than as a hold.
#
# IT USED TO BE A LITERAL RESTATEMENT HERE (WI-498 slice 0 ended that). The
# reason given was the F5 no-shared-module rule — this module could not import
# the derivation engine — so the eight strings were spelled out again and pinned
# equal by tests/test_approval_level.py. F5 was replaced by owner ruling D-8
# (`OI-16`): the vocabulary now has ONE home in `kitlib`, which this module
# already imports, and the pin retired with the restatement it guarded. Drift is
# unrepresentable rather than detected — the WI-448 declared-line precedent.
LADDER_RUNGS = _kitladder.LADDER_RUNGS


# THE OFF-SPINE SIBLING OF THE DIAL (owner ruling OI-30 D3, 2026-08-15).
#
# `human_approval_through` governs the SPINE tiers. The off-spine registries
# that carry an off-spine `status` cell — `interfaces.toml`, `external.toml`,
# `components.toml` — were governed by PROSE ONLY: their headers said the cells
# were the owner's to flip, and at any dial below 4 nothing refused a loop
# session that wrote `approved`.
#
# THE RULED SHAPE IS DERIVED, NOT DECLARED, and the owner's question is why:
# *"I thought this would follow the dev-stage directly? Why build a new enum?"*
# The proposal on the table was a new `[attestation] human_approval_registries`
# list; it was OVERTURNED because the registry-to-rung association ALREADY
# EXISTS in `spine_rules` — `boundary_incomplete` gates DevStg-Boundary on
# `external.toml`'s approvals, and `arch_incomplete` gates DevStg-Arch on the
# component registry. So the association is existing fact, and a second
# declaration of it would be a rival answer that agrees until someone edits one.
#
# NO NEW KEY AND NO NEW ENUM: authority over a status cell in registry R is
# whether R's stage rung is human-held under the EXISTING dial — derived rather
# than declared. WHICH registries that holds is the dial's answer, not a fixed
# list: at a dial holding every rung it is all of them, at this repo's none.
#
# AN UNMAPPED APPROVAL-CARRYING REGISTRY IS HELD. The map is small and the
# registries are optional, so "I do not know which rung governs this" must
# resolve toward more human involvement, exactly as `human_holds` resolves an
# unreadable dial and an unrecognized rung.
#
# THE TABLE LIVES IN `kitlib.authority` NOW (LLR-249) and this is the same
# object, re-exported: the history check reads the rung of a PAST commit's
# status change without importing the coordinator, and one table is what keeps
# the loop's refusal and that report from disagreeing. The assumptions registry
# joined it at the frame's rung (LLR-246).

# THE SPINE SIBLING OF THE TABLE ABOVE (owner ruling 2026-09-01, WI-572).
#
# Same question, same fail-safe, different registries: which DevStg rung is a
# SPINE row approved INTO, so the dial can answer whether that tier's `Status`
# flip is the loop's act or the owner's. Keyed by registry STEM
# (`spine_carrier.stem`) rather than by tier letter because the two callers
# both hold a registry path and neither holds a tier — and because a stem
# survives a carrier change, which a `.toml` suffix would not.
#
# IT HAS ONE HOME BECAUSE IT HAS TWO CONSUMERS AND THEY MUST NOT DISAGREE. The
# mint (`intake._released_drafted_rows`) uses it to decide which Drafted rows a
# merge hands to an adjudicator; the brief
# (`adjudicate_brief.first_approval_values`) uses it to decide which of the rows
# it re-resolves LIVE that adjudicator may actually flip. It was two tables for
# one commit — a registry-keyed one in `intake` and a tier-keyed one in
# `adjudicate_brief` — and the brief's copy was consulted only for the
# amendment arm's aftermath, so the first-approval arm derived its `--approves`
# argument with no dial filter at all: at any dial holding a spine rung the
# brief rendered the owner's held rows as this session's to approve. One table
# with one predicate is what makes that unrepresentable rather than detected.

    The one comparison every consumer makes, stated once. `stage` is
    `spine_rules.spine_stage`'s `DevStg-<Label>` answer — the rung currently in
    work — and a rung the declared level holds surfaces rather than dispatching.

    THE COMPARISON IS AN ORDINAL ON THE ONE LADDER (OI-21 -> WI-493). It reads through
    the ONE ladder. The dial names the highest rung a human still approves, so
    every rung AT OR BELOW it is held — the mirror of the at-or-above rule that
    selects checks. The form retired at OI-21 was `stage < level` over two
    DIFFERENT integer ladders, correct only while they happened to line up, and
    the shape retired at WI-493 was the table that bridged them; what makes the
    comparison sound now is that there is one ladder. That old coincidence is what
    the 2026-08-12 rung insert nearly broke, silently, in the direction of less
    human involvement.

    BOTH ENDS OF THE LADDER ARE ABSOLUTE, and they are now spelled as the values
    they always meant. `DevStg-Release` — the shipped default — holds everything
    including the close, because it is the top rung and everything is at or below
    it. `DevStg-Below` is the sentinel for "nothing is human-held": set below the
    ladder, no rung is at or below it. Only a dial between the two consults the
    stage at all.

    AN UNREADABLE STAGE IS HELD, and so is an UNRECOGNIZED rung label — the same
    conservative direction as an unreadable level. Note the deliberate asymmetry
    with `kitlib.ladder.stage_ord`, which RAISES on an unknown label: there, an
    unknown stage means the ladder moved under a cached value and the operator
    must see it; here, the question is who approves, and the only safe answer to
    "I do not recognize this rung" is "the human does".
