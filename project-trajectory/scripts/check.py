"""The check harness — one command that runs every quality gate locally and in CI.

Stack-agnostic kit, **Python reference implementation**. This is the runnable
version of the "harness contract" in `process.md §7`: format · lint · tests ·
coverage · traceability · doc-navigability · perf-budgets · architecture-map
freshness. Wire it to your stack by
editing the step list the `steps()` function returns below — and the
`SRC`/`TESTS`/tool names in the "EDIT FOR YOUR STACK" block just under the
imports (swap `ruff`/`pytest` for your toolchain); the contract is the *gates and
exit code*, not the specific tools. For a non-Python project, replace the
format/lint/test commands with your own (or drop the ones you don't have); keep
the traceability/flows/doc-navigability/perf-budgets/arch-map steps — they're
stdlib-only and stack-agnostic.

Design choices that keep it honest and CI-friendly:
    - **Never a false green.** Any failing required step makes the whole run exit
      nonzero. We print the real command output; we do not summarize it away.
    - **Missing tool != pass.** If a step's required module isn't importable the
      step is reported SKIP(missing) and (outside --lenient) fails the run, so CI
      can't silently skip linting.
    - **One interpreter.** Tools run as `python -m ruff` / `python -m pytest` with
      the same interpreter running this script, so the launchers' venv python is
      enough — no activated venv or PATH entry required.
    - **Gate-scoped.** `--gate G2` runs only what that gate needs (e.g. G2 needs
      traceability + a runnable harness; G3 needs the full suite). Default runs all.
    - **Tiered tests.** `--tier smoke` runs only the fast subset so you can check
      every iteration; `release` runs everything including slow/hardware tests.
      Tiers map to pytest markers (`-m`); the `Tier` column in test-cases.csv is
      the registry source of truth. An **unmarked test runs in `full` and above**,
      so a forgotten marker can never drop a test from the pre-merge suite. The
      coverage threshold applies at `full`/`release` only — the smoke subset alone
      isn't expected to meet it. CI typically runs `smoke` on push, `full` on PR,
      and `release`/`all` on a release tag.
    - **Non-interactive.** No prompts; deterministic exit codes for automation.

Usage:
    python scripts/check.py [--gate G1|G2|G3|all] [--tier smoke|full|release|all]
                            [--coverage N] [--phase LIST] [--lenient] [--list]

    --gate      Which gate's checks to run. Default: the repo's **active gate**
                from the one-line `docs/gate` file (bootstrap starts it at G1;
                closing a gate = the human bumps it in a reviewed commit), else
                `all` when no gate file exists. This is what keeps a young
                project's CI green-and-honest: it enforces the bar the project
                is actually at, not the end-state bar. G3 (and all) also
                requires every Verification=Test SR to be Status=Verified
                (trace.py --require-verified).
    --tier      Which test tier to run (default: all). Mark fast critical-path
                tests @pytest.mark.smoke and expensive ones @pytest.mark.release
                (markers registered in pytest.ini); leave ordinary tests unmarked —
                they run in the full/release tiers automatically.
    --coverage  Line-coverage threshold percent (default: 80; see COVERAGE_THRESHOLD).
                Enforced for the full/release/all tiers, not smoke.
    --lenient   Treat missing tools as SKIP instead of failure (local dev only).
    --list      Print the step plan for the gate and exit; each step is tagged
                [process] (kit-owned, stdlib, identical everywhere) or [product]
                (language-specific — you wire it to your stack). See process.md
                §7 "process vs product checks".
