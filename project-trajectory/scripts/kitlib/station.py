"""The station's TERMINAL-OUTCOME vocabulary — the lane-close read model.

`SR-144`: every lane close is a terminal state with an immutable record. A lane
declares its outcome by the DIRECTORY it moved its claimed specs into —
`complete/` asserts the work is done, `cancelled/` asserts it never will be,
`partial/` asserts it stopped early. There is no fourth answer and no state file
that could hold one, which is what makes "every lane ends in a merge, branches
never hang" a property of the tree rather than a rule someone has to remember.

EVERY OUTCOME IS TERMINAL. Before `SR-144` a close into any OPEN folder
(`queued`/`draft`/`deferred`) read as a handback, so the returned row went
straight back on the frontier and needed a `blockref` to stop the driver
claiming, closing and re-claiming it forever. Those three are absent from
`OUTCOME_DIRS` on purpose: a lane that closes into an open folder names NO
outcome, and the merge refuses "exactly ONE declared state directory" — the
correct fail-closed posture, because under this contract stopping early is a
state with a name and a report, not a return to the queue.

WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A CONSTANT IN THE MERGE COORDINATOR (WI-483).
Until this module the table lived in `integrate.py`, and every reader of the
vocabulary imported the 2,500-line merge coordinator to reach it. The dashboard
was one of those readers: `traj_panels` — a render leaf that writes nothing and
must not be able to — imported the module that claims lanes, merges branches and
moves specs, for two constants. That import was an edge of the seven-module
cycle the 2026-08-19 repository review recorded (H-02), and the direction it ran
is the one a layered system forbids outright: a VIEW reaching into a MUTATION
service. The vocabulary itself depends on nothing, so it belongs below both.

The POLICY lives here too, not just the table. `outcome_of` answers "which
single terminal outcome do these status directories name?" — including the two
ways the answer is *none*: a spec that landed in no declared folder names none of
the three, and a spec left in TWO declared folders names two. Resolving the
second silently is worse than either (a dict keyed on basename once let the last
`ls-tree` line win, which is plain alphabetical precedence and put `queued` ahead
of `complete`). Reading the git tree stays with the coordinator, where the effect
belongs; deciding what the tree MEANS is a pure function over a set of strings,
and it is testable without a repository.

THE PER-CLOSE REPORT IS THE SAME OBLIGATION'S OTHER HALF (WI-483 slice 2, and
`SR-144` again). "Every lane close is a terminal state WITH AN IMMUTABLE RECORD"
is one sentence, and until this slice its two clauses lived in two modules: the
outcome table here, the record's path, format, read and refusal in the module
that WRITES the record (`handback.py`). That split cost an import edge in the
wrong direction — the merge coordinator refuses a `partial` merge whose report
omits the keep/discard split, so `integrate` reached UP into `handback` for
`report_path` and `report_refusal`, a deferred function-body import that was a
back edge of the five-module strongly connected component the 2026-08-19 review
recorded (H-02). The writes stay in `handback` (they are effects); the report's
SHAPE — where it lives, what it must say, and why a silent one is refused — is a
decision over strings and a dict, so it sits here with the vocabulary it
describes. `handback` re-exports every former name.

Stdlib only, and import-clean of the rest of `scripts/`, like every `kitlib`
module. That is why the frontmatter read below calls `tomllib` directly instead
of `agent_common.read_toml_text`: the four-line guard is the price of the
package rule, and it is the same guard.

Contracts: IF-093 — the seam this module declares (process.md §8; row of record
in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-093: the terminal-outcome vocabulary as CONSTANTS a render may
    import. `OUTCOME_DIRS` is the immutable mapping of declaring `docs/work/`
    status directory to the outcome it asserts — `complete` -> MERGED,
    `cancelled` -> CANCELLED, `partial` -> PARTIAL — and only those three: the
    open folders are absent on purpose, so a lane closing into one names no
    outcome and the merge slot refuses it. `BAR_GREEN` is the refresh
    attestation's git-trailer label. Constants only — no call into a service, no
    write — and the module depends on nothing else in `scripts/`, which is what
    lets a view read the vocabulary without importing the coordinator that
    claims lanes, merges branches and moves specs. It is the same table the
    merge slot classifies a finished lane by, so the picture and the decision
    cannot drift apart.
