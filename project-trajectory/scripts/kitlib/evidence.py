"""The TEST-EVIDENCE carrier: the `docs/test/evidence` record's format, the
declared source surface its claim is bound to, and the readers of both.

WHY THIS EXISTS (WI-500; the ruled plan `docs/plans/2026-08-21-stage-unification-
plan.md` §5's independently sequenced row). WI-498 slice 3 made `DevStg-Release`
EVIDENCE-GATED with, deliberately, no producer: leaving the Impl rung means
"every declared test case PASSES", and the kit had no machine reading of that, so
the top of the ladder was returned by nothing. This module is that reading. The
rule it carries across unchanged is OI-30 D2: **no Status cell — and no
hand-written file — may be the source of "the evidence passed".** The record here
is written by a driver that RAN the harness and saw its exit, or it is not
written.

WHAT MAKES A COMMITTED FILE BELIEVABLE, which is the whole design (the four
sources the program measured absent all failed on one of these):

  1. **It says what produced it.** `command` and `tier` are the harness
     invocation the driver actually ran, and `revision` is the tree's HEAD at the
     time — the declared-figure (`fig:`) discipline applied to a machine record:
     a measurement is evidence only at the revision it was driven on.
  2. **It is bound to the TREE it was measured on, BY VALUE.** `binding` is a
     digest over the content of everything the claim depends on — the spine
     registries (so a test case added afterwards invalidates it) and the declared
     product source and test trees (so a code edit does). This is the WI-492
     precedent: a claim binds to the value it was made about, never to a space or
     a timestamp, so it cannot survive the thing it describes changing.
  3. **Going stale makes the rung UNREACHABLE AGAIN, loudly.** The verdict below
     answers False on any mismatch, so no Release rung is derived from a stale
     record — and because the evidence file is a DECLARED STAGE INPUT and the
     stage fingerprint folds this source digest whenever the file is present, a
     source edit moves the stage fingerprint too: the committed `docs/stage`
     reads STALE and `derive_stage --check` (the commit-bar and CI freshness
     step) FAILS. Stale evidence is a hard finding in the consumer, never a
     warning and never silently ridden.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM. This is not a signature: a determined author can compute
a valid binding by hand and write the file. Forgery resistance would need a key
and a verifier, which is a different (and adopter-hostile) mechanism; what is
built here defeats the failure this kit actually has — a claim that was true once
and quietly outlived its tree — and the honest sentence is that one, not
"unforgeable".

THE SPLIT WITH `stage.py`, and why the composition lives THERE. This module is
pure file-and-path work and imports no sibling. The BINDING is a fold over the
spine registries too, and the spine's declared input list is `stage.py`'s — so
`stage.evidence_binding` composes the two and `stage.evidence_passed` is the
verdict every consumer calls. The dependency runs one way only (`stage` imports
`evidence`), which is what keeps the package free of a cycle.
