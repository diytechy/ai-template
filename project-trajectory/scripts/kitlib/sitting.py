"""A COMBINED lane-checkpoint sitting: its scope tokens and its verdict sections.

WHY THIS EXISTS (WI-841). A lane can owe several in-lane judgements at one
checkpoint - drifted approved rows (the amendment kind), Drafted rows (the
first-approval kind) and a changed Done-when - and one sitting judges them
all. Its row's `Adjudicates` cell holds `<kind>:<id>` tokens and its verdict
holds one `## <kind>` section per kind. Three readers ask about that shape and
must not disagree: the brief that composes the sitting
(`adjudicate_brief`), the act scopes the merge reads each section's act against
(`acceptance_record`), and the merge-time mint that reads the Done-when
section's own drafts (`intake`). So the token form and the section form have
one home, here, below all three.

Contracts: IF-287 - the seam this module declares (process.md §8; row of
record in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-287: a combined sitting's grammar. `SITTING` is the brief class and
    `KINDS` the kinds it composes, in section order; `scopes(tokens)` returns
    `({kind: [ids]}, [malformed tokens])` for `<kind>:<id>` tokens;
    `sections(text)` returns `[(kind, section text)]` in file order for a
    verdict's `## <kind>` headings, `[]` for a single-kind verdict;
    `claim_scope(meta)` is the ONE reader of a claimed row's brief and scope,
    `(brief, {kind: [ids]}, [malformed tokens])`, normalized by
    `declared_brief`/`scope_tokens` exactly as the adjudication route reads
    them; `brief_scope(meta, kind)` is its ids for one kind, `bounds_acts(meta)`
    whether the row bounds its lane's acts, and `malformed_refusal(metas)` the
    merge's refusal of a malformed combined scope; `own_section(text,
    kind, keyword)` is one kind's own part of a verdict, or None when that is
    ambiguous; `GRAMMAR` holds the machine line of each kind it composes
    and its own `SITTING:` line; `parse(text, brief, kinds)` is the ONE
    parser of a verdict file into `{kind: (label, fields)}` (exactly one
    complete machine line per kind; a combined sitting judged against its
    requested kinds), which the coordinator's verdict check and the Done-when
    holds both consume; `requested_path`/`render_requested`/`read_requested`
    are the binding of a sitting's requested kinds beside its verdict;
    `write_binding` is its one writer and `accepted`/`accepted_at` the one
    reader every consumer of a verdict goes through (round 11); every machine
    line naming a declared field twice is refused (WI-870). `review_line(text)`
    is the ONE reader of a review round's `VERDICT:` line, which the attended
    filing boundary and the merge gate's round reader both consume. Pure
    functions over text, except `write_binding` (one file) and `accepted_at`
    (git reads).
