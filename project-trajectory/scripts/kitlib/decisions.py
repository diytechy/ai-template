"""The DELEGATED-DECISIONS RECORD: what one delegated run tells the owner about
the calls it made on the owner's behalf — its path, its format, which closes
owe one, and the note a delegated session is handed.

WHY A RECORD AND NOT AN EXIT (SR-225). A delegated session decides things the
owner would want a second look at: too settled for a pending open item, which
blocks by design, and not settled enough for the log, which records settled
decisions. Such calls had no home, and a prose "decisions for review" file
degraded within one session: the fields it asked for were left out as soon as
nothing read them. So the record is structural — one table per decision, each
carrying four REQUIRED disclosure fields — and it is a RECORD of calls already
made, never a route for work: a call the owner must make, or an act that cannot
be undone, still goes to the owner through the process's exits.

ONE FILE PER RUN (`DECISIONS_DIR/<run>.toml`), named by the lane's branch, so
two lanes never write one file and the directory is never a merge-conflict
surface, the way the log's per-branch fragments are not. A branch name's `/`
becomes `-`, so a run is always ONE file and never a directory.

THE OWNER'S VERDICT IS ONE KEY, AND AN OVERRULE IS ACTED ON (WI-818). A
decision is a direction already taken, so the owner does not approve it: the
owner CONFIRMS it or OVERRULES it (owner, 2026-10-04). Each entry may carry
`owner`, set in place to `confirmed` or `overruled`; an absent key is NOT YET
SEEN. `owner_state` is the one reading, and any other value reads as not yet
seen AND is a format finding, so a typo never hides a decision. The retired
`reviewed` key (WI-790) is a format finding wherever it appears and is never
read: an entry still carrying it reads as not yet seen, whatever `owner` says.
The migrator (`migrate_text`, run by `migrate_decisions.py`) rewrites it, and
no reader keeps a legacy path. An
overrule states the direction instead in the `review` note, so an overruled
entry with a blank note is a finding. The generated owner surface lists every
entry not yet seen under "Decisions to review" and every overruled entry
under its own heading beside the work item citing it (`review_queue`).

An overrule is coupled to work at the COMMIT, the way a ruled open item is
coupled to its citing row (OI-102 Q3): the commit that sets an entry
`overruled` files or amends, in the same diff, a queued or active work item
whose spec cites the entry as `docs/decisions/<run>.toml#D-NNN` (`citation`,
`citations`, `newly_overruled`; the two-tree read is the ruling sync's, in
`acceptance_record`). Amending the queued row the decision was scoped to is
enough; nothing has to be minted. The coupling reads the `owner` key as
written, and FAILS CLOSED: a record the commit's tree carries but cannot parse
is refused, since an unreadable verdict is never "no overrule". Who sets the key stays a convention: git
cannot tell the owner's commit from an agent's without a marker, which the
owner has ruled out.

WHAT IS JUDGED, AND HOW LOUDLY. The merge slot refuses a close that OWES a
record and carries none (`owed`), because a missing record is silence about
every call the run made. Every close owes one, a partial close included: a lane
the machinery closed with no session present is refused too, and the refusal is
a hold for a person to write the record. A malformed entry — a missing or blank
disclosure field, a non-text value, a hoist naming an entry the record lacks —
is REPORTED and never refused (`record_findings`; the one refusal is the
overrule sync's unparseable record above): the record exists, the owner
can read what is there, and refusing the merge over one field would strand
finished work for a reporting defect. An entry numbered `-000` is the template's
example and is never judged, so the template stays copy-ready.

A kitlib module: stdlib only, importing nothing.

Contracts: IF-255, IF-256 — the seams this module declares (process.md §8; rows
of record in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-255: the delegated-decisions record, as a FILE. One TOML file per
    delegated run at `docs/decisions/<run>.toml`, a `/` in the run's name
    becoming `-`, committed on the lane's branch by the session that made the
    calls and read off that branch's tree by the merge slot. A top-level
    `high_risk` list of entry ids names the entries the writer judges deserve
    the owner's eyes first (empty when none). Each decision is a table
    `[decision.D-<digits>]` carrying `decided`, `alternative`, `reversal_cost`
    and `why_not_escalated` as non-blank text and `review` as text, empty until
    the owner writes a note in place, and may carry `owner`, the owner's
    verdict: `confirmed` or `overruled`, absent meaning not yet seen
    (`owner_state` reads it). An overruled entry's `review` note states the
    direction instead and is not blank. `reviewed` is retired: a format
    finding wherever it appears, never read, and the entry carrying it reads
    as not yet seen. A work item cites an entry as
    `docs/decisions/<run>.toml#D-<digits>`. Other keys are the writer's and
    are not judged; an entry id ending `-000` is inert.

Contract IF-256: the delegated-decisions record, as a CALL. `MODES` is the
    dial's alphabet (`off`, `record`, `escalate-first`); `REQUIRED_KEYS` the
    entry's required keys; `record_path(run)` the file's repo-relative path;
    `record_findings(text)` one finding per defect IF-255 names, `[]` for a
    sound record, never raising; `owed(mode, outcomes)` whether a close under
    the dial `mode`, with at least one claimed row closed, owes a record;
    `session_note(mode, run)` the instruction a delegated session is handed,
    `""` under `off`; `owner_state(value)` `confirmed`, `overruled`, `""` for
    the absent key (not yet seen), or None for a value it does not recognize;
    `review_queue(text)` the entries not yet seen and the entries overruled,
    each high-risk first, and the count confirmed; `citation(rel, entry_id)`
    the token a work item cites an entry by and `citations(text)` every such
    token in a text; `newly_overruled(before, after)` the entries overruled in
    `after` and not in `before`, raising `ValueError` when `after` does not
    parse; `migrate_text(text)` the record with the retired key rewritten
    (complete top-level assignments only, the result re-parsed and refused
    unless only the verdict keys changed), and the ids it could not rewrite.
    Pure functions of
    their arguments: no file, git or environment read.
