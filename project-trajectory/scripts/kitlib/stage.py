"""The STAGE carrier: the declared derivation inputs, their fingerprint, the
`docs/stage` file format, and THE COMMON READER every consumer of "what stage is
this repo in" calls.

WHY THIS IS A MODULE (WI-498 slice 1, the stage unification program; the shape is
the ruled plan `docs/plans/2026-08-21-stage-unification-plan.md` §§1-3 and the
design record's §4.2). Until now the only machine reader of the stage was
`agent_common.spine_stage_of`, which REGEX-SCRAPED the value out of a comment on
a generated cache — a reader that could not tell a fresh value from a stale one,
and whose `\\b`-terminated pattern truncated a hyphenated label to a DIFFERENT
VALID RUNG (the deep-check's Q2(v-b), driven). This module replaces that seam
with a contract: **recompute the fingerprint of the declared inputs on every
call; return the recorded value only when it still holds; otherwise derive fresh
in memory.** Freshness stops being something a schedule has to arrange and
becomes something each call establishes.

`ladder` (slice 0) is the pure vocabulary this derives OVER; it sits strictly
below and imports nothing. This module imports stdlib and `ladder`, nothing else.

THE BOUNDARY, AND WHY IT IS A CALLBACK (the deliberate choice this slice owes a
record). The derivation proper — load the spine registries through the carrier,
fall through the eight rungs, group by phase — is ~600 lines that live in
`spine_rules` today and are REWRITTEN by slices 2 and 3 (the ladder
re-discriminates; the bar axis is deleted out from under them). Hauling that into
`kitlib` now would (a) drag `spine_carrier` and the whole registry-parsing graph
into a package whose one asserted rule is that it imports no sibling
(`tests/test_bootstrap.py::test_bootstrap_imports_only_the_common_package`), and
(b) move code that is about to be rewritten, which is work performed twice — the
same argument slice 0 gave for leaving the bar axis where it was. So the split
is by PURITY, not by subject:

  * HERE: everything that is a pure function of paths, bytes and rung labels —
    the declared input list, the fingerprint, the file format, the ordering
    (including the sentinel), the floor, the per-phase fold, and the reader's
    control flow.
  * IN `derive_stage.py`: the parse of the registries into per-phase rung
    labels, which needs the carrier.

The reader therefore takes `derive` as an ARGUMENT. It is not a plugin registry
and not a lazy import: a caller that wants the self-healing path names the
deriver it trusts, and the fresh-derivation branch is visible at every call site
instead of hidden behind a module global. `derive_stage.read()` is the one-line
wiring every production consumer calls.

WHO THE FRESHNESS GUARANTEE COVERS, stated once so no surface has to overclaim
it. `read_stage` recomputes the fingerprint on every call and derives fresh on a
mismatch, so no SELECTION or RATIFICATION consumer can read a stale stage, on
any lane — and those are exactly the three call sites that reach it (`check.py`,
`agent_common`, `check_trajectory`). The DISPLAY surfaces deliberately do not:
`traj_parse._stage_value` and `traj_status._stage_facts` parse the recorded file
directly, so a generated artifact describes the commit it ships with. That is
coherent with READERS NEVER WRITE below, and it means the honest sentence names
the consumer class rather than saying "no consumer, on any lane" — an
unqualified universal the dashboard and the status block are standing
counterexamples to (ROUND-OPUS 6, on the one property this program is named
for).

READERS NEVER WRITE (plan §3). Nothing in this module opens a file for writing.
The committed `docs/stage` is load-bearing history — the phase-drop and tier
signals (slice 4) are deltas of the COMMITTED file — so regeneration stays an
auditable act at the trunk regen points and the commit-bar `--check` still
refuses a commit whose committed copy is stale. A reader that healed the file on
disk would rewrite that history from whichever process happened to look first,
and would do it on claimed branches and in CI where the freshness step is
deliberately stood down.

# --- THE FILE -----------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE_FILE = "docs/stage"

# THE SELECTION FLOOR. The effective stage is never reported below this rung, for
# the reason the BAR axis floors at the same place (`spine_rules`'s
# `max(BAR_REQS, raw)`): a value below it selects NOTHING under an at-or-above
# rule, so a fresh scaffold would go green because no check ran — the silent green
# SN-008 forbids, and the exact promise `ci/check.yml` makes ("a freshly-scaffolded
# DevStg-Reqs repo is green"). The floor is a SELECTION guarantee, not a claim
# about the repo: `live-stage=` beside it carries the honest, unfloored reading,
# and `floored=yes` says plainly that the two differ. This is the direction
# process.md §4 mandates — a derived reading shown BESIDE the honest one, never
# instead of it.
FLOOR = ladder.STAGE_REQS

# THE SENTINEL, WHICH IS NOT A RUNG. `DevStg-Below` means "this phase has nothing
# settled to have earned a rung with" — the per-phase analogue of the arithmetic
# sentinel the bar axis folds through. It is legal in a per-phase VALUE and
# nowhere else: `stage=` may never carry it, because the ladder deliberately has
# no rung you sit at below Needs (process.md §4). `order()` places it below every
# rung so it participates in comparisons without raising; `require_rung()` refuses
# it, so it can never become the headline by an unnoticed fall-through.
BELOW = "DevStg-Below"

# THE RUNGS A PER-PHASE READING CANNOT OWN (WI-498 slice 4). Three of the eight
# rungs are decided by REPO-WIDE inputs even when `spine_stage` is called with one
# phase's rows: `DevStg-Needs` (the need registry and — through `cited_srs` — the
# repo's whole settled SR set; slice 1 added that seam precisely because coverage
# is a repo-global question), `DevStg-Boundary` (`boundary_incomplete` over the
# repo's external registry) and `DevStg-Arch` (`arch_incomplete` over the repo's
# component registry). The frame arguments are passed WHOLE to every per-phase
# call, so when a per-phase value lands on one of these it is a repo-wide fact
# wearing a phase's label: every phase reads the same rung, and none of them is
# reporting anything about its own content.
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR: an event detector comparing a phase's reading against a
# recorded reach must ABSTAIN on these values rather than conclude a drop — the
# reading is dominated, so "below the recorded reach" is true of the repo and
# unattributable to the phase. The other five rungs (`Reqs` via the phase's own
# Drafted SRs, `LLReqs`/`Tests`/`Impl` via its own children) ARE the phase's, and
# a comparison against them is sound.

# --- THE DECLARED DERIVATION INPUTS -------------------------------------------
# THE ONE LIST (plan §2). The derivation is a pure function of exactly these
# files; adding an input (the test-evidence carrier, when the Release rung is
# evidence-gated) is an edit HERE and the fingerprint covers it automatically.
#
# The owner's concern was that fingerprinting "the repository" is expensive and
# duplicates other scans. It dissolves with the inventory: the input set is not
# the repository, it is under a dozen files totalling a few hundred KB. Every
# current consumer already PARSES these same files wholesale, which costs far more
# than hashing them, so the fingerprint is a fast path that lets a fresh reader
# SKIP the parse — the net scan count goes DOWN.
#
# Each row is (declared path relative to the repo root, carrier suffixes). A
# logical input resolves to whichever carrier is present, in the declared order;
# ABSENCE IS PART OF THE FINGERPRINT, because a registry appearing or disappearing
# changes the derivation (a repo that adopts no component registry simply never
# sits at the Arch rung — so the file's absence is an input value, not a gap).

    # original "over-inclusion costs milliseconds" argument priced the wrong
    # cost — the real price was a RED commit bar after every policy-dial edit,
    # because the committed fingerprint went stale over a file whose value never
    # reaches the stage. Dials govern who may ratify, not what stage is derived.
    # If a dial ever DOES enter the derivation, add its file here in the same
    # change that reads it.
    #
    # THE TEST-EVIDENCE CARRIER (WI-500) — the promised one-list edit, made. The
    # derivation now reads it (`DevStg-Release` is returned only when the record
    # holds), so a record appearing, changing or vanishing moves the fingerprint
    # exactly as a registry edit does. Its suffix tuple is `("",)` because the
    # file has no carrier variants: the declared path IS the file.
