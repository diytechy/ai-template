"""THE SPINE RULES: what a registry row means, and which stage rung a row set
stands at. A pure library — it derives, it never writes.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS, AND WHY IT IS NAMED THIS (WI-498 slice 5). It was
`derive_gate.py`, and it derived a three-value BAR that it cached to `docs/gate`.
That axis is gone: the ruled stage unification (OI-51) made the eight-rung ladder
the one answer to "where is this repo", so the bar, its ordinals, its
per-artifact rules, the cache it was written to and this module's whole CLI were
DELETED — 1,523 lines to 807. What survived is the half every caller actually
wanted: the row predicates, the maturity tables, and the rung fall-through.

The old name was defended in this very docstring — "the FILE keeps its name;
`docs/gate` and `derive_gate.py` are paths adopters invoke literally" — and that
argument expired with the file. A module named for a value it no longer derives,
shipped beside a path that no longer exists, is the accreted dishonesty this
program exists to remove. `spine_rules` pairs with `spine_carrier`: the carrier
LOADS registry rows, these rules JUDGE them.

THE LAYERING, top to bottom:

  * `kitlib/ladder.py`  the eight rung labels and their order. Imports nothing.
  * `kitlib/spine.py`   the ROW vocabulary: the Status predicates, the
                        LLR-exemption set, the phase parse and the SN id scrapes.
  * `spine_rules.py`    (here) the predicates over rows, and `spine_stage` — the
                        fall-through that decides which rung a row set stands at.
  * `derive_stage.py`   the per-phase fold, the record, the file, the CLI.
  * `kitlib/stage.py`   the `docs/stage` format, the input fingerprint, and THE
                        COMMON READER every consumer of the stage calls.

WHO CALLS IT: `derive_stage` (for `load_spine` + `spine_stage`) and
`baseline_snapshot` (for the maturity vocabulary). Nothing else imports it, and
nothing runs it — there is no `main()`.

THE RUNG FALL-THROUGH, in one sentence each. `spine_stage` returns the LOWEST
rung anything still holds open, so the answer is "what is in work":

  0 `DevStg-Needs`      a Drafted need, or an approved need no SR answers.
  1 `DevStg-Boundary`   a declared external frame with an unsettled crossing.
  2 `DevStg-Reqs`       a Drafted SR.
  3 `DevStg-Arch`       a declared partition with an unsettled component.
  4 `DevStg-LLReqs`     an SR with no LLR (unless its Verification is
                        LLR-exempt: Analysis / Inspection / Attest).
  5 `DevStg-Tests`      an SR with no TC, or a Drafted LLR/TC.
  6 `DevStg-Impl`       everything above is settled. THE FALL-THROUGH LANDS HERE.
  7 `DevStg-Release`    RETURNED BY NO CELL, EVER. Leaving Impl means the
                        declared tests PASS, so the rung's one input is the
                        `evidence_passed` verdict over the harness-written
                        `docs/test/evidence` record (WI-500) — a value bound to
                        the tree it was measured on, never an approximation.

The two INSERTED frame rungs (1 and 3) read REPO-WIDE registries even when this
is called with one phase's rows, so a per-phase caller must treat them as
unattributable — `kitlib.stage.REPO_GLOBAL_RUNGS` declares the set and
`check_trajectory`'s phase-drop detector abstains on it.

Rungs 2 and 3 RECURSE as the decomposition descends; rung 4 is TERMINAL by
OI-20's binding rule. Requirements come before architecture because architecture
is a RESPONSE to requirements (process.md §4).

HOW THIS COMPOSES WITH `trace.py`. Trace ENFORCES structure — orphans,
decomposition, approval — at the selected stage; these rules DERIVE the stage
from the same rows. A Drafted row is exempt from trace's orphan rule (so it can
live in the live spine) yet holds its rung open here (so it is visible as work in
progress). Auditing correctness is the whole point, so every rule is
fixture-tested (`tests/test_spine_rules.py`).

Stack-agnostic, standard-library only. The row vocabulary this module used to
duplicate from `trace.py` under the retired F5 rule now has ONE home,
`kitlib.spine`, and is re-exported below (WI-448 slice 3) — this still never
imports the joined-spine engine.

Contracts: IF-050, IF-051 — the interface seams this module declares (process.md §8; rows of record in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

# These nine names were DUPLICATED between this module and trace.py under the

# POLICY — what a Status word means, which Verification methods decompose to a TC
# but no LLR, what a Phase cell parses to, which SN ids exist and which are cited
# — and a policy disagreement between the module that ENFORCES the spine and the
# module that DERIVES its stage is a false green or false red AT A GATE (WI-099).
# D-8 replaced the pins with one home: `kitlib/spine.py`. The names are
# RE-EXPORTED here, exactly as the ladder's were at WI-498 slice 0, because
# `spine_rules.is_approved` is the spelling `derive_stage` and the test suite
# already read, and re-pointing every citation is churn this slice does not need.
# The rules' own rationale travelled with them and is NOT restated here.
#
# `LLR_EXEMPT` WAS A `set` HERE AND A `tuple` IN trace.py — behaviour-equal under
# `in`, so the value pin was blind to it. The one home is a `frozenset`; see its
# comment there for why immutability is the right answer for a shared kernel's
# closed vocabulary.

# module reaching for `spine_carrier` would smuggle the whole script graph into
# the scaffolder (`tests/test_bootstrap.py`). So the copy is deleted rather than
# relocated — both modules now BIND the sibling function directly under the same
# local name, which is what the two wrapper bodies were worth.
#
# What the wrapper's docstring carried is the carrier's own claim and lives on
# `spine_carrier.draft_ids_from_text`: under TOML draft-ness is a FIELD, under
# legacy markdown it was SECTION-AS-STATE, and the dispatch between them is
# load-bearing rather than tidy — a heading scan over a TOML file finds no
# headings, reports zero drafts, and floats the derived stage upward.

# are SHARED VOCABULARY this module's readers spell `spine_rules.is_approved`,
# not private helpers of a rung. Under the pins that was an argument that had to
# be made; now it is just what a re-export is for.


# `is_planned` WAS DELETED AT D-9 STEP 5 (not re-keyed) with the word it read:
# OI-30 D1 folded `Planned` into `Approved`, so `is_approved` answers for those
# rows and the `planned=` basis counter goes with the predicate. It was step-2
# insurance against a value no predicate recognized, and its own docstring said
# it would be deleted here rather than migrated.
#
# `is_modified` WAS DELETED AT D-9 STEP 7 on the same terms, as its own docstring
# promised. It marked "approved text that has since moved" and survived step 5
# only so the kit never had a commit with NO drift detector; its successor (the
# `docs/archive/last_approved/` comparison) ran alongside it through the signing.
# `modified=N` went with it, for `planned=`'s reason: a count of a value the
# closed enum cannot hold counts integrity errors, not pending rows.


# --- SN-029 / OI-21: THE EIGHT-RUNG STAGE LADDER, the one derived axis --------
# IT WAS THE SECOND OF TWO until WI-498 slice 5, and the history is worth one
# paragraph because the same mistake was made three times. A separate BAR axis
# answered "how strict is the harness right now" while this one answered "how far
# has the decomposition got", and before that a single G-numbering tried to carry
# both and could express neither: its middle tag meant "LLRs and TCs exist" AND
# doubled as the pull an amended row applied, so no tag meant "TCs are in
# process". Forcing one token to carry two questions is how a dial comes to mean
# something subtly different at each of its reading sites; splitting the token
# without splitting the question just moves the ambiguity.
#
# THE RULED MODEL (owner 2026-08-12, re-ruled 2026-08-13 as OI-21, unified at
# OI-51): **stages are the rungs of the decomposition, and a repo is IN exactly
# one.** Certification is an EVENT at a rung boundary — a named human's reviewed
# Status-change commit — recorded where events are, not as a rival value. The
# stage is state; approval is what moves it.
#
# THE VOCABULARY ITSELF MOVED OUT (WI-498 slice 0, plan §5 item 0). The rung
# strings, their order, `STAGE_OF`, `STAGE_DESC` and the `stage_ord` lookup are
# `kitlib.ladder`'s — one home, imported by everyone, so the equality pins that
# used to hold `agent_common`'s restatement in step retire: the drift is now
# UNREPRESENTABLE rather than DETECTED (the WI-448 declared-line precedent,
# `tests/test_rule_sync.py`). The names are RE-EXPORTED below because
# `spine_rules.STAGE_*` is the spelling six modules and the test suite already
# read, and re-pointing every citation is churn this slice does not need.
# The ladder's own design rationale — why requirements precede architecture, why
# the label and not the ordinal is the identifier, why it is not monotonic —

# --- THE MATURITY MAPPING TABLE — ONE HOME (OI-21 question 5b) -----------------
# THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES. The min-fold folded over SN/SR/LLR/TC only, which is why
# rung 1 (Boundary) had no machine-readable state and rung 3's `CMP.State` was
# read by nothing that gates. Folding IF and CMP in is what makes the recursion
# self-reporting — but those two registries carry their OWN maturity vocabularies,
# and the spine carries a third — which, since D-9 migration steps 5/7/8, is
# `Drafted`/`Approved`/`Founded` and therefore SPEAKS THIS TABLE'S OWN WORDS.
#
# So every vocabulary maps onto ONE set of ladder semantics, stated here and
# nowhere else:
#
#   DRAFTED   the row exists but is not settled — it CAPS its rung (work in flight)
#   APPROVED  the row is settled at its tier — it does not cap
#   FOUNDED   the row is settled AND demonstrated — it does not cap
#
# The migration promised this would be a TABLE EDIT rather than a predicate
# rewrite, and step 5 is that edit landing: `SPINE_MATURITY` below is the spine's
# row of this one table, and it is DECLARED rather than inferred — the previous
# revision had every other tier in the table and the spine only in prose.
DRAFTED, APPROVED, FOUNDED = "Drafted", "Approved", "Founded"

# THE SPINE (SR/LLR/TC `Status`) — the row D-9 step 5 added. Keys lower-cased,
# like every other table here (`_maturity` lowercases before the lookup), so this
# is the closed `STATUS_VALUES` vocabulary spelled in the ladder's own terms.
#
# THE TRANSITIONAL `modified` ROW LEFT AT STEP 7, as this comment's previous
# revision said it would; the state it named is now read by comparing the row
# against its `docs/archive/last_approved/` copy, which is not a maturity.
# `founded` JOINED AT STEP 8 under the rule that governed the rename: it maps to
# FOUNDED, which does not cap, so a row at the top rung cannot read as work in
# flight and hold a rung open. Its demonstration is computed per tier (migration
# plan C4), never asserted by this table. `DevStg-Release` still does not follow
# from a `Founded` cell — that is the harness's answer, and OI-30 D2's ceiling is
# now enforced by the rung having NO PRODUCER at all (slice 3) rather than by a
# cap on a per-artifact bar rule.
SPINE_MATURITY = {
    "drafted": DRAFTED,
    "approved": APPROVED,
    "founded": FOUNDED,
}

# `SPINE_TRANSITIONAL` AND `SPINE_MATURITY_READ` ARE DELETED (WI-498 slice 5).
# They named the retired SPINE spellings — `modified`, `implemented`, `verified`,
# `planned` (all read as APPROVED) and `draft` (read as DRAFTED) — and existed so
# `maturity_bar` could tell a mid-migration registry from a typo. `maturity_bar`
# was the ONLY reader of the composed table, and it retired with the bar axis, so
# what was left was a lookup nothing looked up.
#
# WHAT THAT CHANGES, STATED RATHER THAN ASSUMED: the spine tiers are read by
# `is_drafted`/`is_approved`, which compare the cell against the LIVE words. An
# unmigrated `modified` or `implemented` cell is therefore "not drafted" and does
# not hold its rung open — the same answer the deleted table gave it. Only
# `draft` changes hands: it used to CAP, and now reads as settled. That is a real
# tolerance lost, and it is recorded here rather than left for a reader to
# discover, because the closed-enum integrity rule (`trace.py --strict-schema`)
# is what names such a cell now, and it names it LOUDLY instead of quietly
# absorbing it. The off-spine tables below keep their own transitional readings;
# only the spine's went.

# BOUNDARY CROSSINGS — the depth-0 frame's `[boundary.B-##]` rows in
# `external.toml` (rung 1). `Status` is the tier's ONE maturity field — the name
# it carries since the 2026-08-17 registry status unification, which retired the
# transitional `Approval` spelling this table was first keyed on.
#
# THIS TABLE REPLACED AN `IF_MATURITY` KEYED ON `Stability` AT WI-442, and the
# swap is the whole reason that commit could not be split. `Stability` was the
# sole input to `boundary_incomplete`; deleting the column without re-keying the
# predicate in the same commit would have left every IF row reading an
# unrecognized value, which `_maturity` maps to DRAFTED — rung 1 pinned open
# forever by a column that no longer exists, reporting the right stage for
# entirely the wrong reason.
#
# NOT Founded on `approved`, for the reason the old table gave and which
# survives the re-key unchanged: an approval says the crossing is agreed, it says
# nothing about the crossing having been demonstrated.
# `drafted` (not `draft`) since D-9 step 5b: the off-spine approval vocabulary
# moved with the spine's so ONE word means one thing across every registry —
# `interfaces.toml` and `external.toml` cells, both file headers, and the two
# shipped templates changed in the same commit.

# CMP rows — the partition (rung 3).
# CMP now speaks the ONE enum (registry status unification, 2026-08-17), and
# that collapses this table to the identity over it. What it used to hold was
# two axes at once: `planned`/`built`/`verified` were maturity spelled in
# regenerated retired spine words, while `has-gap`/`deprecated` were LIFECYCLE
# facts folded onto maturity — exactly the conflation SN's `kind` was. The
# lifecycle half moved to its own `standing` field, which this table does not
# map because it is not a maturity — but ONE of its values still answers a
# rung-3 question, and `CMP_STANDING_CLEARS` below is where it answers it.
#
# CMP KEEPS ITS OWN TABLE rather than sharing `SPINE_MATURITY`, RE-EXAMINED at
# D-9 step 8 rather than inherited: the two are byte-identical as of that step,
# so collapsing them is the obvious move. Declined on the unification plan's own
# §7(c) recommendation — two registries' vocabularies that HAPPEN to coincide,
# not one with two names. They have already diverged in both directions (CMP
# reached `founded` first; the spine carried `modified` and CMP never did), and
# one shared table would make the next per-registry subset (which decision 12
# provides for) a change to the OTHER registry's ladder.
#
# `founded` is REACHABLE HERE and nowhere else off-spine: a demonstrated
# partition is a claim something computes, which is the whole test for whether a
# tier may carry the word.

# (a demonstrated partition that also records a gap: precisely the combination
# the new axis was created to make expressible) closes rung 3 (2026-08-17 desk

        as "adopted but empty". `trace.py` ignores every id ending `-000` and

    available: nothing in the schema typed a crossing as external, so the rung
    could only report whether the INTERNAL seam inventory had settled and call it

    no external.toml now skips rung 1 rather than being held by its internal
    seams, which is the correction, not a loosening.

    WARN-HONEST WHEN IT DOES APPLY. A registry that exists but declares NO real
    crossing is honestly incomplete: the file says the project intends to type its
    frame and has not. And any crossing at DRAFTED maturity (`approval = "draft"`)
    is a frame declared and not yet approved. Both cap the rung.

    APPROVAL, NOT REALIZATION COVERAGE — the two readings of the ruling, resolved
    rather than assumed. 13u's wording gates on BIF *approval*; §1R.5's wording
    ("every declared BIF settled, every BIF realized or explicitly deferred")
    names approval AND a second conjunct. They are different predicates, and this
    is the first: whether each declared crossing carries a realizing IF row is
    DECISION 6, deferred BY RULING to post-schema (sitting-2 §4.0), and gating on
    it here would take a decision nobody has. It is not a hypothetical gap — four
    of the six locked crossings are realized by no IF row today, so the second
    conjunct would hold rung 1 down on work decision 6 has not yet scoped, and it
    would do so under a predicate that reads like approval. When decision 6
    lands, adding the conjunct is a two-line change HERE, with the coverage rule
    stated in its own docstring.

    NOTE WHAT THIS STILL DOES *NOT* CLAIM. An approved crossing is agreed, not
    demonstrated. Nothing here reports that anything was built."""

    DRAFTED maturity (`Status = "Drafted"`) is a scope proposed and not yet
    realized.

    TWO AXES ARE READ, not one. The registry status unification (2026-08-17)
    split CMP's single field into `Status` (maturity) and `standing`
    (lifecycle), and `standing = "has-gap"` is a direct statement that the
    partition does not hold — a rung-3 fact wherever it is spelled. It is read
    through `_standing_holds_rung`, whose comment carries the restored
    rationale; without it a `Founded` row could record a known gap and still
    report a finished rung.

    THIS IS THE RUNG THAT MAKES THE RECURSION SELF-REPORTING. Rungs 2 and 3
    oscillate as the decomposition descends, and the mechanism is exactly this

                        Reached ONLY through `evidence_passed`, see below

    THE `Modified` ARM OF THE Reqs RUNG RETIRED AT D-9 STEP 7 — no cell records
    "amended after attestation" any more, and the successor (the snapshot
    comparison) is deliberately NOT read here; see the rung itself.

    THE TWO INSERTED RUNGS (OI-21) read from the IF and CMP registries, which
    joined the fold here — see `boundary_incomplete` / `arch_incomplete` for the
    applies-when that keeps them free for a project that adopts neither.

    THE SPINE RUNGS STILL READ PREDICATES (`is_drafted`/`is_approved`/
    `is_founded`) rather than `SPINE_MATURITY`, and that is not an oversight:
    the rungs need distinctions finer than the three-way ladder (which child is
    Drafted, which SR has not been blessed), while the ladder answers only "does
    this cap its rung". Since `maturity_bar` retired with the bar axis (slice 5)
    the spine's own table has no reader left in this module; it stays because it
    is a shared VOCABULARY, pinned by `test_rule_sync` and read by
    `baseline_snapshot`, not because a rung consults it.

    DevStg-Release IS REACHED FROM EXACTLY ONE INPUT, AND IT IS NOT A CELL
    (WI-500; WI-498 slice 3 left the rung deliberately unreachable and named this
    row as the only thing that could change that). `evidence_passed` is the
    verdict of `kitlib.stage.evidence_verdict` over the committed, HARNESS-WRITTEN
    `docs/test/evidence` record: the declared suite ran, every case passed, and
    the record is still bound BY VALUE to this exact tree. No combination of
    Status cells reaches the rung, the parameter defaults False so every caller
    that does not supply harness evidence gets the honest Impl reading, and a
    caller CANNOT synthesize it from rows — the only production supplier is
    `derive_stage`, reading the file.

    THIS DISCHARGES THE OLD Impl->Release CAVEAT AND CARRIES OI-30 D2's GUARD
    ACROSS. That caveat read: "DevStg-Impl ends when every SR reads `Approved`,
    which is a registry CELL, not a harness run ... nothing here should be read
    as proof the tests passed." The swap it owed is made — not by finding a
    better cell, but by ruling that NO cell may make the claim, and then by
    building the non-cell reading the ruling implied. D2's ceiling said the same
    thing on the bar axis by capping `sr_bar`; here the guard is structural in a
    stronger way: **a Status cell can never claim the evidence passed**, because
    the rung's one producer is a parameter no row can set.

    WHICH RUNG OWNS A MISSING ARTIFACT: the rung the artifact belongs to, not its
    parent. An SR with no LLR yet is DevStg-LLReqs, because what is being written
    is an LLR. Reading it as DevStg-Reqs (the older shape) made the lower rungs
    unreachable during exactly the period they describe — every SR had to be fully
    decomposed before a Drafted child could be seen at all — which left the axis
    unable to express "TCs are human-held but LLRs are not", the distinction the
    axis exists for.

    WHICH RUNG OWNS AN UNBLESSED SR: it is checked LAST, after the children. An
    SR reaches `Approved` only once its LLRs and TCs are green, so while a child
    is still in flight the child's rung is the honest answer. (A two-case rule
    until step 7, which retired the `Modified` case that was checked FIRST.)

    `cited_srs` IS THE SCOPE OF THE NEED-COVERAGE RUNG, and it exists for the
    PER-PHASE call (WI-498 slice 1). The coverage question — "does every approved
    need have a requirement answering it" — is repo-global: a need answered only
    by phase 1's requirements is answered. Running this function over one phase's
    rows with the default would read every OTHER phase's needs as uncovered and
    report DevStg-Needs for every phase but the first. So a per-phase caller passes
    the repo's whole (settled) SR set here while `srs` stays the phase's own rows.
    Default `None` means "the rows I was given", which is the repo-wide call and
    is byte-for-byte what this function did before the parameter existed.

    Two corners are explicit. A repo with no real SRs at all is DevStg-Needs, NOT
    DevStg-Release — the vacuous-lowest-bar short circuit in `_raw_level` exists
    for the bar's own arithmetic and would read as "everything is finished" here,
    which is precisely backwards. And an APPROVED-BUT-UNCITED SN is DevStg-Needs,
    applying WI-401's coverage rung on the same subset `_raw_level` uses: a need
    with no requirement answering it is unfinished work at the needs rung."""
