"""Architecture seams, components, contracts, and spec-boundary decisions.

This module owns the architecture inventory joins: interface connectivity and
contract declarations, seam-to-test coverage, component containment and
cross-component edges, code-symbol crosschecks, and spec interface citations.
Trajectory lifecycle, phase, staleness, and CLI composition stay in
``check_trajectory``.

Contracts: IF-263 — the interface seam this file declares (process.md §8; row
of record in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-263: ``check_trajectory`` imports and re-exports this module's
architecture rule surface. Inputs are a repository root and the spine/config
files beneath it; outputs are normalized inventories or finding strings. The
module performs no writes and exposes no command-line entry point.

    `[(source, message)]` for every header the contract GRAMMAR refused, so a
    refusal is reported rather than read as "declares nothing" — and, above
    all, rather than DISARMING the gate: the refusal used to be caught for the
    whole scan and answered with `(None, [])`, so one malformed body anywhere
    in the tree silenced every other row's verdict too (adversarial review
    2026-08-29, F1). A refused source is absent from `sites` rather than
    entered as declaring nothing, which would hand its rows to the reverse
    check's warn instead of this gate's finding. A source the scan could not
    READ is deliberately NOT in `problems`: that is the reference's own "could
    not read" list and `arch_inventory`'s skip. `(None, problems)` when there
    is no surface to read — files-mode, an absent scan root, no generator

    """THE ARMED DEFINITION GATE (OI-67 slice 6). Every interface row must be
    STATED — declared on its owner's `Contracts:` marker and given a
    `Contract IF-###:` body there — because under the one-owner shape the body
    is the definition's only home: a row with no body is an interface with no
    definition. Returns finding strings; the caller prints them WARN plain and
    promotes them to ERROR under `--strict`, the `if_tc_coverage_findings`
    idiom, sharing its `[checks] interfaces_check` opt-out.

    ONE RULE, FOUR SHAPES. (1) The owner declares the id and states no body —
    "declared, not stated", the reference's own debt line, now a finding.
    (2) An `external:`-owned row is declared and stated by the kit module on
    its FAR SIDE — the consumer that reads the external surface, or the
    requestor that drives it — because the external party's header is not
    ours to write and that module is the one in-tree home of OUR READING of
    the surface; where the far side names several kit modules any one of them
    may state it. (3) A stray declaration — a source declaring an id the
    registry owns to a different in-tree source — because the owner is the
    ONE declaration site and a second copy is a second definition waiting to
    disagree; a far-side module stating an external-owned row is not stray.
    (4) A source whose header the contract GRAMMAR refuses — an empty
    `Contract IF-###:` opener, a body before its marker, a duplicate body, a
    body carrying an HTML comment — because nobody can read what it states:
    its declared rows count as unstated, and the refusal is named once per
    source rather than once per row it takes down with it.

    WHAT STAYS A WARN, on record: an owner that declares NOTHING is the
    owner-exact reverse check's finding (`_owner_exact_findings`, warn-only),
    not this gate's — the ruled rule is "a DECLARED seam with no body", and
    promoting the undeclared case would red every fixture and adopter row
    whose owner has not yet been headed at all, which is the migration list
    rather than a defect in a stated definition. The dodge that leaves —
    never declare, never owe a body — is visible in that warn and in the
    reference's summary line, and is the owner's to promote. Vacuous where
    there is no surface (files-mode, an absent scan root), the
    `arch_inventory` posture; an unreadable source is the reference's own
    list, not a finding here."""

    THE ALLOWLIST IS A MIGRATION DEVICE, NOT A PERMANENT EXEMPTION SURFACE. It
    was seeded at the population measured when the ruling executed (the file's
    own header carries the exact count, command and revision) — the standing
    never-green-by-list-edit rule (session-protocol skill §2) governs every
    entry: adding one to silence a genuinely NEW uncited seam is ACCEPTING what
    it measures, not laundering it, and should carry its own reason. An
    allowlisted seam still counts in `interface_findings`' total; it simply does
    not error here. `if_tc_allow_hygiene_findings` reports — never blocks — a
    listed seam that has since gained a TC, so a shrinking list (the declared
    burn-down) stays visible rather than silently absorbed.

    Opt-out shares `interface_findings`' `[checks] interfaces_check` dial —
    same data, same switch — AND its ≤1-module arch-map vacuity: the promoted
    rule must arm on no MORE than the warn it promotes, so a `files`-mode or

    DELIBERATELY UNCLAIMED — this function declares no back-link at all.
    `LLR-042` (`SR-159`) is
    `Approved`, and its own `detail` says the connectivity layer emits its
    findings "without changing exit status" — true of `interface_findings`,
    which this function does not touch, and now FALSE of the seam-TC rule this
    function promotes. Amending an Approved cell overrides attestation (the
    sitting's act, the SR-006/LLR-060 precedent, WI-473); minting a fresh
    Drafted LLR under `SR-159` was considered and declined for the same reason
    that session gave first — `SR-159` is phase 1, and a Drafted child would
    drag that phase's derived bar down as a side effect of unrelated work. So
    the built behaviour is ahead of its requirement on purpose, recorded as

# --- Implements-tag vs CodeSymbol crosscheck (WI-502; OI-53 ruled (d)) --------
# The 2026-08-21 closing review found the CodeSymbol dozen (WI-501) by hand:
# resolve every `Implements:` tag's ENCLOSING def/class and compare it against
# its row's `CodeSymbol`/`Module` claim. This promotes that manual method into
# a continuous warn-first finding, so the next stale batch is measured rather
# than rediscovered by campaign. WARN-FIRST FOREVER by the ruling — no
# allowlist, no `--strict` arm — because it checks a TRACED, not APPROVED,
# cell (process.md §8's `Module`/`CodeSymbol`/`TestRefs` "traced, not
# approved" posture, cited at check_trajectory.py:77) and a mismatch is
# routine drift, not a defect to gate a commit over.
#
# ONE HOME for the AST walk (WI-486): `gen_arch_map.implements_report` builds
# the (tag site -> enclosing symbol) map and the known-symbol-name set; this
# function only compares them against the registry, the way `arch_inventory`
# already consumes `gen_arch_map.scan_inventory` rather than re-walking trees.

    A **finding** (unchanged since WI-064) is an edge whose endpoint component
    sets are DISJOINT and which no declared IF-### row covers.

    An **advisory** (WI-440, OI-14) is an edge the overlap guard SUPPRESSES only
    because an endpoint is tagged into more than one component: the sets
    intersect, no IF row covers the pair, and `len(cmps) > 1` somewhere. That
    edge would be a finding under a partition where each module belongs to one
    component, so the multi-membership is EVIDENCE ABOUT THE PARTITION (the file
    splits, the shared part is its own component, or the boundary is drawn
    wrong) rather than a licence to stay quiet. Reporting it reverses the
    direction of the old rule, where authoring one more `Component` tag
    monotonically silenced the check — a fail-open the author controls.

    An edge whose endpoints are single-tagged into the SAME component is
    ordinary intra-component wiring and is neither.

    A THIRD, EARLIER exit (OI-48 ruled (d), WI-494): an edge whose
    DESTINATION is a declared shared-kernel module (`read_kernel_modules`) is
    not a seam at all — neither a finding nor the multi-membership advisory.
    Checked before the overlap split, so a kernel module that still carries a
    residual multi-tag is not ALSO advised about (the advisory exists to
    surface undeclared candidates; a module already declared kernel is a
    settled candidate, not an open one). One-directional by construction —
    the exemption keys on `dst_n`, never `src_n`, so an edge OUT of a kernel
    module stays exactly as policed as any other edge.

    ONE scan per run, cached per root: the two public wrappers used to each
    trigger their own scan from `main`, so the two tiers were computed from two
    separate reads of the same registries — the exact could-disagree state this
    function's contract forbids (and a review round demonstrated with a

    Opt-out via `[checks] components_check = false`. Five rules, all off the arch-map ⇒

    - **Top-view right-sizing** (WI-073/FB5): vacuous when the arch-map inventory
      has ≤ TOP_VIEW_MAX modules (a small or pre-arch-map repo can never exceed the
      bound — the bound, not the registry, is the rule). Only when the inventory
      itself is larger than the bound do the declared components decide: a
      right-sized handful of top-level CMPs brings the top view back under it.
    - **Knowledge⇒component coupling** (WI-153; research-knowledge.md §3a,
      owner-ruled 2026-07-14): when ≥1 knowledge pack exists the component web is
      *expected* — any arch-map module the CMP join leaves uncontained is a finding
      regardless of the bound, because packs tie the *what* to the knowledge behind
      the *how* and that web must be robust wherever packs are enabled. Arms the
      existing join from pack presence; invents no new join, and is dormant (no
      cost to a non-adopter) until `docs/knowledge/` holds a real pack.
    - (The WI-399 "containment owed where a module is ADDED" delta rule is
      RETIRED — WI-455 made the inventory the LIVE source tree, so a lane's
      added module is simply IN the inventory and the coupling rule above
      fires on it directly; there is no committed-vs-disk gap left to bridge.)
    - **Cross-CMP edges need a declared seam** (WI-064): see
      `cross_component_findings` — an import edge between two components with
      no covering IF-### row. Its warn-only sibling
      `cross_component_advisories` (WI-440) reports the edges a multi-tagged
      endpoint silences; main() prints those, not this function, because they
      must never reach the exit code. An edge into a declared shared-kernel
      module (OI-48 (d), WI-494) is exempted from BOTH before either can fire
      — see `_cross_component_scan`.
    - **Declared-kernel allowlist hygiene** (OI-48 (d), WI-494): see
      `kernel_allow_parse_findings` — a `docs/kernel-modules-allow` line the
      grammar cannot read (missing module, missing reason, or no separator)
      is reported, the same parse-honesty shape
      `if_tc_allow_hygiene_findings` and `provenance_allow_parse_findings`
      use for their own allow-files. A malformed line grants no exemption
      either way (fail-safe), so this rule is reporting, never gating, the
      fail-safe default — it just says so out loud instead of leaving the
      author to notice a seam finding that did not go away.

    Until decision 4 this function also demanded a rationale on the citation line
    of any `Stability = Experimental` seam — the forced nearest-existing-IF
    search. Its arming input was DELETED: the slimmed tier has one maturity
    field with two values, and neither means what `Experimental` meant ("proposed
    and not yet pinned by a second consumer"). Re-keying onto `approval ==
    "draft"` was the obvious move and is the WRONG one: it silently changes the
    predicate to "not yet approved", which on this repo's registry arms 113 of
    113 rows instead of 5, and it does so at a severity that ERRORS under
    --strict. A rule whose blast radius multiplies twentyfold while its sentence
    stays the same is not the same rule.

    So the arm is GONE rather than approximated, and its loss is a recorded
    finding of the re-tier (log entry, WI-442) with a home at sitting 3: if the
    forced search is worth keeping, it needs a value that means "proposed",
    which is a vocabulary decision (D-9/decision 12), not a checker's to invent.
