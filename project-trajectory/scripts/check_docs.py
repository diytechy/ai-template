"""Doc navigability & staleness check: keep the hand-written doc set honest.

The harness already gates the freshness of *generated* blocks (the code map —
`gen_arch_map.py --check`), but nothing checks that the **hand-written** docs
stay navigable: that every intra-repo link resolves, every doc is reachable,
and a doc hasn't been frozen beside churning code. This operationalizes the
"verify no broken intra-doc links" step several gates ask a human to do by hand,
extending the "the map must stay honest" guarantee from code to docs
(process.md §3 "Reviewability").

Stdlib only, like trace.py / check_flows.py:

    python scripts/check_docs.py [--root .] [--docs docs] [--entry PATH ...]
                                 [--ignore GLOB ...] [--strict-orphans] [--stale]

It scans root-level `*.md` plus everything under `docs/`, then reports five
finding classes:

  - **broken intra-repo links** (target file/dir or `#anchor` missing) — a hard
    finding; exit 1.
  - **orphan docs** (no path from an entry root: root-level `*.md`, an optional
    `docs/index.md` Map-of-Content, or a `--entry`) — a warning by default; exit
    1 only with `--strict-orphans`. A fresh scaffold legitimately has standalone
    docs (interfaces, stakeholder-needs) until the project links them, so the
    floor is warn, not fail. Docs under `docs/archive/` (frozen history) are
    exempt — orphanhood is noise there, though their links are still validated.
    A repo may also declare *expected* live-orphan classes in
    `docs/orphans-allow` (one glob per line): retained evidence — reviews,
    closed-WI specs, dual-plan round artifacts — that stays on disk but is not a
    navigation node stops warning individually (an aggregate `note` replaces the
    per-doc noise) and never fails, even under `--strict-orphans`. Only a
    *newly introduced* orphan outside every declared class still warns (or fails
    under `--strict-orphans`) — the no-new-orphan ratchet, baselining history
    without freezing it. Absent file => today's behavior unchanged, so the kit
    never surprises an existing repo.
  - **the vision tag** (process.md §4 DevStg-Reqs's mechanizable half): the root README
    must carry the singleton `PROJECT-VISION:` tag exactly once — zero (the
    canonical vision statement is missing) or several (a re-authored variant;
    other docs point at the tag, never restate it) is a hard finding; exit 1.
    No root README at all degrades to a warning (a louder, different problem).
  - **README need coverage** (**opt-out**; process.md §4 DevStg-Reqs): traceability is the
    kit's core value, so the root README is held to it too — every SN id cited
    anywhere in it must exist in the stakeholder-needs registry, and every
    Must/Should need in that registry must be cited somewhere in the README, so a
    requirements change mechanically ages the README. Draft/unapproved needs (under
    a "draft" heading — SN maturity is section-as-state, §4a) are exempt from that
    floor until approved. No delimiter markers: any
    `SN-###` in the README counts as a citation. A README opts out with an
    `<!-- sn-inventory: off -->` comment; a repo with no real needs yet (only the
    `-000` placeholder) is vacuously clean, so a fresh scaffold passes.
  - **staleness** (`--stale`, git-gated): a doc linking a *non-doc* file
    (source/asset) that was committed more recently than the doc itself — a
    "lying map" heuristic. Printed as a **`hint`**, a severity below `WARN`: it
    is a low-confidence nudge to look, not a finding (a linked file often
    changes without invalidating the prose), so it never counts toward the exit
    status. Degrades to a clean skip when git is unavailable or off a work tree.
    Docs under `docs/archive/` (frozen history) are exempt — staleness is noise
    there.

  - **status-surface structure** (**warn-only**, never the exit code;
    process-options.md "Trajectory / work-items layer"): `docs/status.md` is the
    lean status snapshot, so (S-1) it warns past a line budget — default 120,
    `docs/status-lint` overrides with an integer or the one word `off` (which
    disables S-1..S-3); (S-2) its Open-items marker must precede the `## Scope`
    heading (open items surface at the top); (S-3) with
    `docs/requirements/open-items.toml` present, every `OI-N` inside the
    Needs-<human> block has a PENDING row there (no undocumented owner ask) and
    every pending id appears in status.md (no orphan brief). S-3 **retires under
    a generated snapshot** (WI-202): once status.md carries the
    `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED STATUS -->` block, its open-items list is PROJECTED
    from that registry, so the two cannot disagree — the `status-map` freshness
    gate is the invariant and S-3 stands down (S-1/S-2 still guard the
    hand-authored region). S-3 extraction is best-effort over the template's
    shape; a custom layout misses warnings, never false-fails. Vacuous when
    status.md (or, for S-3, the registry) is absent.

The root `OWNER_SCRATCHPAD.md` is exempt from all of the above: it holds the
human owner's free-form private notes and is dropped from doc discovery entirely
(agents must not read or act on it; its own header says so).

Scope (the high-value 80%): inline links `[text](dest)` and same-file/`file#frag`
anchors against GitHub-style heading slugs (plus `{#custom-id}` suffixes and
`<a name=...>`/`id=...`). Out of scope by design: reference-style links
(`[t][ref]`), images (`![alt](src)` — skipped, not existence-checked), links
inside fenced/inline code, and links inside a `+++` spec frontmatter block (all
three stripped before parsing — frontmatter is typed data, so a `title` quoting
a link is describing one, not making one). Anchors are only validated against
Markdown targets the script can parse.

Contracts: IF-002, IF-030, IF-112 — the interface seams this module declares (process.md §8; rows of record in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).
