"""Spine-row TEXT rules and the row primitives they share (WI-329).

Split out of `trace.py`, which owns the JOIN — this module owns the question
"is this one row readable and decidable on its own?", asked nine ways:

| function                    | tier     | what it catches                        |
|-----------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| `provenance_findings`       | gating   | the row carries its own history        |
| `provenance_advisories`     | advisory | a living cell carries a citation frame |
| `off_spine_advisories`      | advisory | the same, on CMP/EXT living cells      |
| `form_findings`             | gating   | the row is not one testable obligation |
| `paraphrase_advisories`     | advisory | the child re-words its parent          |
| `ac_advisories`             | advisory | a comparative with no named predicate  |
| `sr_artifact_advisories`    | advisory | a requirement cell names an artifact   |
| `sn_artifact_advisories`    | advisory | a need's acceptance names an artifact  |
| `sr_fanout_advisories`      | advisory | an SR's direct-LLR fan-out is merged   |
| `ears_advisories`           | advisory | a condition stated outside EARS        |

They are PURE predicates — rows in, findings out. No I/O, no git, no
filesystem, no argv — which is the pure-core / I-O-shell split process.md §3
asks for, and what makes them cheap to test in isolation.

The row primitives (`refs`, `is_example`, `is_drafted`) are RE-EXPORTED here from
`kitlib.spine`, their one home since WI-448 slice 3. They used to be DEFINED here
and duplicated in `spine_rules.py`; `trace.py` still imports them back from this
module by name, so the dependency runs one way and there is no cycle.

The shared-`_kitcommon` shape this module's split once avoided is no longer ruled
out — owner ruling D-8 (`OI-16`) replaced F5, and `kitlib` IS that home, shipped
as a whole directory so a partial copy ImportErrors rather than degrading. What
stays true of this file is the narrower claim: it is one module's own TEXT core,
imported by that one module (ADOPTING.md §6).

Contracts: IF-076 — the seam this module declares (process.md §8; row of record
in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Requirements: LLR-004 (ac_advisories), LLR-133 (provenance_findings),
LLR-134 (form_findings), LLR-135 (paraphrase_advisories),
LLR-179 (ears_advisories).

# Before it existed, an external actor and a rotted path were INDISTINGUISHABLE:

    """Warn-only: a real SR row whose PROSE names a critique instrument while its
    `Verification` field declares some other method.

    **Two cells describing one thing, compared by nothing.** A row states its
    verification method twice — once as the `Verification` enum, once in the
    prose that says how anyone would know the row is satisfied. Nothing checked
    that the two agreed, and the failure is silent by construction: the enum
    still validates, the joins still resolve, every strict gate passes at rc=0
    while the row instructs a reader to obtain a verdict its own method does not
    produce. Measured occasion (kit meta-repo, log `2026-08-16p`): SR-052/053
    flipped `Critique`->`Test` on 2026-07-26 when their anchors were bound to
    tests, and their AcceptanceCriteria went on demanding an APPROVE verdict
    from rubrics whose headers by then read RETIRED. Three weeks, several
    reviews and a full re-tier pass read those rows without the mismatch
    surfacing mechanically.

    Scanned cells: `Rationale` and `AcceptanceCriteria` — the defect is not the
    AC's alone. A `Rationale` arguing that acceptance *is* adjudicated by an
    independent eye rots exactly as hard on a row carrying twenty passing tests,
    and lives one cell over from where anyone looks.

    `Requirement` is NOT scanned, and the exclusion is measured rather than
    assumed: scanning it fired on SR-040, whose shall enumerates the session
    phases a coordinator routes (`PLAN/BUILD/REVIEW-A/REVIEW-B/DESIGN-CHECK/
    CRITIQUE`) — the word there NAMES a phase, it does not claim a verdict. The
    distinction is not cosmetic: a requirement cell states the obligation, while
    the METHOD claim this lint hunts lives in the two cells that say how anyone
    would know the obligation is met. Widening back to `Requirement` would put a
    standing false accusation on a correct row, which is the fastest way to
    teach an author to skip this pipe.

    ONE DIRECTION ONLY. A `Verification=Critique` row that names no instrument is
    NOT reported: the rubric it is judged against is the `docs/rubrics/`
    convention's business and a row may legitimately leave the naming to its TC,
    so the reverse check would fire on correct rows. Warn-only, never the exit
    code — the fix is a re-worded cell, which is an amendment on the author's
    schedule, not a gate's.

    Known and accepted under-detect, stated so it is never implied as covered:
    detection is the token AS WRITTEN, so a cell that describes a critique
    without using the vocabulary ("judged by a fresh independent session")
    passes. Warn-only makes an under-detect cost a missed hint, while a looser

# --- The wider provenance vocabulary (owner ruling: NO provenance citation in
# any living registry cell) --------------------------------------------------
#
# The two shapes above are the GATING class and keep that severity. These are the
# rest of the citation frame the ruling names — ruling, sitting, review-round and
# open-item references, decision ids, edit-history verbs and date stamps — and
# they are WARN-FIRST, always. Severity is not a taste call here: the population
# is ~300 tokens over ~150 live rows, so a gate would wedge the harness on work
# the repo has scheduled rather than skipped, and a rule that stops the build to
# demand prose rewriting is one a session routes around.
#
# EVERY PATTERN IS A STRUCTURED SHAPE, never a bare English word, and that is the
# whole design. Four false-positive hazards are on record and every one of them
# is MEASURED over the live registries rather than argued:
#
#   1. A general `<LETTER>-<n>` id pattern was TRIED AND REVERTED once (see the
#      `_IF_DECISION_RE` note in trace.py) because it read the data pack's own
#      `M-10` crossing ids as rulings. So the id shapes here are enumerated
#      literally — `OI-`, `D-`, `RULING-` — and nothing generalises over them.
#      Re-measured at each widening: `M-10` is matched by none of them.
#   2. `ruling` / `retired` / `attestation` / `amended` are SUBJECT NOUNS in the
#      rows that specify the approval machinery itself — 217 occurrences over
#      108 live SR/LLR/TC rows, with SR-149, SR-165 and LLR-118 the worked
#      instances. A verb grep would destroy every one of them. `_EDIT_STAMP_RE`
#      therefore requires the verb to be followed WITHIN ONE CLAUSE by an ISO
#      date: a row *about* amendment never carries one, a row *recording its own*
#      amendment always does. Measured: 0 of those 217 are flagged.
#   3. THE SAME SUBJECT-NOUN HAZARD RECURRED, in an arm that was never measured.
#      A `C-<HAT>-<n>` "review-round code" arm shipped 2026-08-18 and was
#      MEASURED AT 20 HITS, 20 OF THEM FALSE — a 100% false-positive rate. Every
#      live occurrence names a hat-charter CLAUSE as the thing the row answers
#      ("C-MNT-3 gives every declared vocabulary value exactly one normative
#      definition", "C-PRF-1 wants a declared improvement", "…the MAINTAINER
#      clause this row answers"), which is a standing constraint cited like a
#      standard's clause — the row's REASON, not its history. The arm is GONE,
#      not narrowed: the token carries no signal about which use it is, the
#      distinguishing signal is the FRAME around it, and a frame is what the two
#      edit-stamp arms below already detect. Where a clause code genuinely rides
#      inside a stamp ("REWORDED 2026-08-17 (C-PRF-1, applied)") the stamp is
#      reported and the whole frame is what gets stripped.
#   4. AN ALL-CAPS EDIT VERB IS A STAMP ONLY WHERE A CLAUSE OPENS. `APPROVED`,
#      `RETIRED`, `DELETED`, `RULED` and `AMENDED` are also ordinary
#      participles mid-sentence — "an APPROVED SN cited by zero SRs", "an AMENDED
#      requirement drops the derived stage", "a stale file is DELETED in the same
#      act" — so `_CAPS_EDIT_STAMP_RE` fires only at the start of the cell or of
#      a clause. Measured over every live spine + IF cell: 36 hits, 36 of them
#      genuine stamps, 0 false; the mid-clause participles are all silent.
#
# A bare ISO date is read as provenance in a REASON cell only. A normative cell
# may legitimately carry a date as DATA (a fixture, a declared cutover value), so
# there it reports only behind an edit verb.

    agent, or a downstream adopter with none of this project's history — must read
    one row and know what the system does and why, without resolving a work item
    they cannot see. Both facts have ONE better home: which WI delivered or amended
    a row, and why it was decided that way, live in the log — and the row OBEYS the
    process rather than citing it. (The finding text used to send an author to
    `work-items.csv` as well. That carrier is RETIRED and its presence is itself an
    integrity finding, so the message was naming a dead file as the place to move
    provenance TO; the three neighbouring messages were re-pointed at the log in
    the same-day sweep and this one was missed.)

    Applied to every SPINE registry, not just the SR. The rule shipped SR-only and
    that was the wrong scope: measured across the whole spine afterwards, 2 SRs
    carried a WI id in their normative text — and **26 LLRs, 8 TCs and 9 more SR
    Title/Rationale cells did too**, none of them watched. The largest pocket was
    the layer the SR-only rule could not see, and it kept growing while the rule
    was green (an `LLR` written the same week the lint landed carried three).

    Narrow BY MEASUREMENT, not by taste. It flags exactly two token shapes. A
    SCRIPT name (65 SR rows), an ARTIFACT PATH (6) and a RUBRIC (5) are NOT
    flagged and must never be: this kit's product IS its scripts, so the name is
    the system under specification, and for a `Verification=Critique` row the
    rubric is the acceptance instrument. A rule that cries wolf on 65 legitimate
    rows is a rule that gets scrolled past — the `check_doc_refs` lesson.

    GATING under `--strict` (owner ruling 2026-07-27, raised at the first
    re-attestation sitting on finding `LLR-050`'s `WI-316:` changelog prefix). It
    shipped warn-only on the argument that cleaning a `Verified` row flips it
    `Modified` and owes a re-attestation, so the checker should not pick the
    owner's schedule. The counter-argument won and is the stronger one: a warn
    nobody must act on is how 43 rows accumulated, and the whole population was
    cleaned in one pass at the same sitting, so the rule now guards zero-to-zero
    rather than dictating a cleanup.

    KNOWN COST, accepted deliberately: a WI id is forbidden even where it is the
    DATA rather than a citation — a row describing the dashboard's own rendered
    nodes cannot name one. That case is real (it occurred once, in a measurement
    of which node box a wire grazed) and the row was reworded to describe the node
    instead of naming it, with the specific id kept in the log. A carve-out would
    cost more than it buys: any exemption a checker cannot distinguish from the
    defect is one an author can reach for.

    The gating rule above forbids two token shapes in three tiers. This is the
    rest of the same ruling: **no provenance citation in any living registry
    cell** — no ruling, sitting, review-round or open-item reference, no decision
    id, no edit-history verb, no date stamp — on all FOUR spine tiers, and in the
    REASON cell as loudly as in the normative ones.

    The reason cell is the point. It is the one cell whose job is argument, which
    is why every citation drifts into it, and the repealed reading let a citation
    ride along as "optional context on top of a sentence that stands alone". What
    it produced, measured on the live registries, is `Rationale` cells that are
    mostly changelog: `REWORDED <date> (<round code>, <hat>; <sitting> item 8
    ruling): …`. A reader with none of this history cannot resolve any of it, and
    the durable half — what breaks without the row, which alternative lost —
    is buried in the middle of it.

    THE REWRITE IS NOT A DELETION. Drop the frame, KEEP the reason, restated as
    standing prose; where the block has no forward-looking half at all, the log
    already holds it and the block goes. Deleting the citation and the argument
    together is the failure the rationale rule exists to prevent, and it is the
    likelier failure now that the frame is forbidden — which is why this reports
    a worklist and never a gate.

    WARN-FIRST, ALWAYS, and that is a severity ruling rather than a stage. The
    population is ~300 tokens over ~150 live rows; a gate would stop the harness
    on a prose-rewriting campaign, and the rows that matter most — the ones whose
    frame is the only record of an unresolved question — need a reviewed
    exception, not a red build. `allow` carries those, TOKEN-SCOPED: each key is
    `<ROW-ID> <Cell> <token>` and silences that token alone (see `is_allowed`).

    Rows arrive in two shapes. The SN tier comes from `spine_carrier.load_needs`
    (lower-case keys, id under `id`); the other three carry `<TIER>-ID` and
    Title-case cells. One table, keyed by the id field, rather than a second
    function for the need tier — the scoping error this rule already made once
    was having a tier the check could not see."""

    honest in either shape. A gating version would be a script overruling the
    author on the one question the author is better placed to answer.

    Scope is the SR `Requirement` cell alone. An LLR carries no obligation to
    pattern (it decomposes one, and `form_findings` already refuses a `shall`
    there), and a TC states a method rather than a requirement.

    A `Drafted` row is IN scope, unlike the gating form rules beside it. Those
    skip Draft because an unfinished acceptance criterion is what Draft means;
    a sentence's opening is finished the moment it is written, and a warn-only
    reading costs a drafter nothing while the row is still cheap to re-shape.
    Both rows this rule found at landing were Drafted, so skipping them would
    have shipped a guard that had never once fired.

# All three are ADVISORY and stay advisory. They report a TIERING smell — a row
# that decided which artifact carries a capability, or a row that merged several
# decisions and grew a fan of children to cover them — and a smell is exactly
# what a human decides. None ever joins the exit code under any flag. R2's
# no-concrete-artifact rule reaches the SN tier too (`sn_artifact_advisories`,
# owner directive 2026-08-18); the fan-out rule is SR-only by construction.

# A concrete Python artifact named in a cell: a bare script (`trace.py`) or a
# path-qualified one (`scripts/trace.py`). Anchored on the literal `.py`
# extension with a word boundary each side, so "numpy", "happy" and "occupy" —
# words that merely END in "py" — cannot match: the dot is the whole signal.
# The CRITIQUE-instrument vocabulary, for the verification-coherence lint below.
# UPPERCASE-only on the three words, deliberately: the corpus writes the
# instrument and its verdict in caps ("a fresh CRITIQUE session ... returns
# APPROVE"), while lowercase "approve"/"critique"/"verdict" are ordinary prose an
# SR may legitimately use — SR-137 and SR-148 both say "the integrator's verdict
# gate" about a subsystem. Matching those case-insensitively would cry wolf on
# the common word and train an author to skip the pipe.
#
# `rubric` IS case-insensitive and needs no path, and that half was measured
# rather than guessed. Across all 63 SR rows of the kit's own registry the bare
# word appears in exactly the three that carried the defect and nowhere else,
# while the path-anchored form (`rubrics/`) missed all three — the rot had shed
# the path and kept the claim ("adjudicated ... against a written rubric").
# `adjudicat\w*` was measured too and REJECTED: it adds SR-137 and SR-148, both
# naming the loop's work-item adjudication arm, so it buys two false accusations

# below — one declared-marker grammar in this module, not two.
#
# RENAMED FROM `13v` (2026-08-18), which was a DECISION ID, and that made the kit
# contradict itself in four places at once: `provenance_advisories` bans a
# decision reference from every living reason cell, while `sr_artifact_advisories`
# and `sn_artifact_advisories` INSTRUCTED an author to write one into that same
# cell to record a waiver. Three arguments, any one of which is sufficient:
#
#   1. IT SHIPS DOWNSTREAM. The token names log decision 2026-08-13v of THIS
#      repo. An adopting project has no such decision, so the kit was telling
#      every adopter to cite a ruling they have never been able to read — the
#      exact defect the provenance rule exists to prevent, shipped as an
#      instruction.
#   2. THE MARKER IS MACHINERY, AND MACHINERY SHOULD READ AS ITSELF. A declared
#      token an author writes to claim an exception is a control word, like
#      `fan-out re-stamp:`; naming it after the meeting that authorized it makes
#      a reader resolve a citation to learn what a keyword means.
#   3. THE COLON EARNS ITS KEEP. `\b13v\b` matched prose ABOUT a waiver as
#      readily as a claim of one — measured on the live registry, its only two
#      hits were SR-140 and SR-147, whose rationales say the waiver is SPENT. A
#      stale sentence was standing as a live valve. `recorded waiver:` demands
#      the marker be followed by the reason it exists.

# one-`shall` waiver's finding still fires, accepted knowingly. The artifact
# advisories are its readers.

    requirement that names `trace.py` has decided two things in one row — that
    the capability exists, and that *this artifact* carries it — so the row
    cannot be re-carried without re-writing an obligation, and the binding is

    ("read off the current carrier, as the current set: ..."), the LLR `Module`
    cell (who implements), and the shipped-file inventory (why it ships).

    Two independent censuses, deliberately not folded together:

      * PER ROW — a `*.py` token in `Requirement`, unless the row's `Rationale`
        carries the declared marker `recorded waiver: <reason>`. The waiver is
        the same valve the one-`shall` rule declares, not a second grammar.

      * PER ARTIFACT — more than one SR naming the same artifact token, WAIVED
        ROWS INCLUDED. A waiver excuses one row from stating a binding; it says
        nothing about two rows sharing one artifact identity, which is the
        tiering defect R1 names ("one home per method") and a strictly different
        finding. Counting waived rows here is what keeps the second census

    PRESENCE ONLY. Whether the surviving wording is genuine capability or
    artifact-CLASS voice is judgement, and stays the consistency review's — this

    they have never opened. The condition ("the strict traceability check reports
    zero orphans") survives every re-carry; the carrier's name belongs at SR

    SCANS `acceptance` ONLY, and that is a division of labour rather than an

    NO PER-ARTIFACT CENSUS, unlike the SR arm. "Two rows sharing one artifact
    identity" is R1's *one home per method* defect, and a method is a requirement
