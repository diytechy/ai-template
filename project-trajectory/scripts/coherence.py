"""THE COHERENCE RULES — do the loaded registry rows agree with each other?

The sibling of `census.py` (*what do the registries LACK?*) and `pending.py`
(*what does the OWNER hold?*), answering the third question the same engine used
to answer inline: **does every id a row cites name a row that exists, and does
every row have the children its tier requires?**

WHY THESE AND NOT trace.py's OTHER FORTY `*_findings` FUNCTIONS (the boundary,
stated because a decomposition that cannot say where its line is has not drawn
one). Everything here is a JOIN ACROSS ROWS: the rule needs two rows, or a row
and a set derived from other rows, to have an opinion at all. What stays in
`trace.py` is everything that does not —

  * per-row PROSE inspection (form, EARS, provenance, paraphrase, the AC and
    tiering advisories): one row in, findings out;
  * CARRIER sweeps (`structure_findings`, `integrity_findings`,
    `enum_integrity_findings`, `placeholder_findings`, `schema_findings`):
    these ask about the FILE and the raw pre-filter rows, and they are the half
    of the checker that knows a registry is a CSV or a TOML;
  * the report/console renderers, the approval + watermark machinery, and the
    CLI.

`trace.analyze` composes both halves and stays their only caller, so nothing
here is reachable except through the engine that always ran it.

THE ONE I/O EXCEPTION IS NAMED, NOT BURIED. `knowledge_pack_advisories`
resolves a `docs/knowledge/` ref to a real file, so it touches the filesystem —
the single rule in this module that does. It cannot move to the loader: the
paths come out of the rows. `analyze`'s docstring has always said "no I/O" and
this call has always been inside it; the extraction states the exception rather
than leaving a reader to find it.

Stdlib only. A PLAIN SIBLING and deliberately not a `kitlib` module: this
package must stay import-clean of the rest of `scripts/`
(`tests/test_bootstrap.py::test_bootstrap_imports_only_the_common_package`),
and while every rule here happens to import only `kitlib.spine` today, these
are the CHECKER's rules — the scaffolder has no business importing them, and
`census.py` recorded the same reasoning one slice earlier.

The row's `Implements:` tag sits on `spine_orphan_findings` below, not here: the
cross-check reads the ENCLOSING symbol of a tag, and a module-scope tag on a row
whose CodeSymbol names nine functions resolves to nothing it can match.
