"""THE ASSUMPTION TIER'S RULES — pure joins over the assumptions registry.

The sibling of `frame_rules.py`, and built the same way: every rule here is a
JOIN ACROSS ROWS, it reads no file, and `trace.analyze` composes it and stays
the only caller of its rules. `trace.py` is held to an exact size ratchet, so
the tier's rules land here and `trace.py` grows by the composition lines alone
(spine map D21). Two other readers take one derivation from here and no rule:
the stage derivation and the red-TC census read `da_citing_srs`, because an
assumption's citing requirements are what place and count its evidence. And
the observation writer reads one rule, `record_policy_problem`, so the record
it refuses is exactly the record the checker would fail.

What the tier records. A requirement states what the system does at its own
boundary and a stakeholder need what a person experiences; between them sits a
claim about the world, and a false one makes a fully verified system deliver
nothing. `docs/requirements/assumptions.toml` holds each such claim as a row of
its own (`[assumption.DA-###]`, SR-191): where its outcome lands, what it
assumes, when it holds, the obstacle under which it fails, its maturity and its
validity. Beside it sit the stand-ins that answer for an outside party in tests
(`[surrogate.SUR-###]`, SR-192); a stand-in is evidence only as far as it
matches the party it replaces, so an assumption naming it in `RealizedBy`
states that match, and lands on a crossing of a party it emulates.

Each requirement then cites the assumptions its argument relies on
(`DA-Refs`), or records in `Coincident` why its own specification alone
delivers its needs (SR-193), and declares its `Form` (SR-194). An assumption no
requirement cites, or with no falsifying signal, is reported (SR-196). The need
link stays on the requirement: an assumption's needs are derived from the
requirements citing it (`da_citing_srs`), and nothing records them on the
assumption.

EVIDENCE FOR AN ASSUMPTION IS A TEST CASE (SR-197): its `Assumption-Refs` name
the assumptions it evidences, in place of or beside what its `Verifies` names.
And many such tests are OBSERVATIONS (a person reading a render, a measurement
across an adopter's first week) that the harness cannot rerun. A test case
recorded as not automated declares the inputs its judgment reads, how many days
its result holds, and, evidencing an assumption, how it samples (SR-198), so a
changed input or an expired lifetime can make the result stale without anyone
re-judging it. Those declarations are judged here too; they apply to every
observation case, with or without a frame.

AND THE RESULTS THEMSELVES. Each observation result is a record of its own
(`kitlib.observation`, SR-199), judged here against the case it names. An
assumption's evidence level is derived from current results alone, never from
a cell (SR-200); one shown false, by its standing or by a failing sample, is
listed with every requirement, need and case relying on it (SR-201); and a
recorded accepted risk covers an assumption only while the texts the act
accepting it saw still stand and no sample has failed since (SR-202).
`trace.main` has the files and the history these rules need read once
(`record_observation.evidence_inputs`) and composes them through
`observation_evidence_findings`.

WHERE THE TIER APPLIES. An assumption's outcome lands on a boundary crossing,
so with no declared crossing there is nothing to land on and the whole tier is
silent (SR-191's applies-when). And the requirement-side reports ask nothing of
a project that has not adopted the tier: until the registry holds a real
assumption row, no requirement is asked for a citation or a form. Every
adopter is scaffolded the blank form, so the file existing is not adoption.
The two rules at the end of this module stand apart (IF-208) and wait for no
declared crossing: each boundary interface is asked whether assumptions bridge
it or its reading is the outcome (SR-211), and each assumption's obstacle
perspectives are resolved against the hats roster (SR-214). The bridging rule
takes the requirement side's adoption rule whole, so a project that never
adopts the tier is not handed one line per boundary seam: before the first real
assumption row, every assumption a seam names is necessarily undeclared, so a
failure that survived would be that worklist under another name.

Rows are the carrier's column-keyed dicts (`DA-ID`, `EffectAt`, `SUR-ID`,
`Emulates`, `SR-ID`, `DA-Refs`, `EXT-ID`, `B-ID`, `Entity`), exactly as
`trace.load_registries` hands them over; a list cell arrives `;`-joined. Every
function returns plain finding strings, and no function writes to a row it is
handed.

Stdlib only. A plain sibling of `scripts/`, not a `kitlib` module, for the
reason `coherence.py` records: these are the checker's rules, and the
scaffolder has no business importing them.

Contracts: IF-190, IF-200, IF-201, IF-208, IF-216, IF-226 — the seams this
module declares (process.md §8; rows of record in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-190: the assumption tier's rule surface `trace.py` imports. Rows in,
    findings out, and nothing else: no I/O, no git, no filesystem, no argv.
    `assumption_tier_findings(srs, das, surs, exts, bifs)` is the tier as the
    checker composes it and returns `(frame, integrity, advisories)`: the
    frame list joins the frame class and `trace.py --strict`'s exit code, the
    integrity list joins the always-on `--strict-integrity` floor, and the
    advisories ride the warn pipe and never join a failure set. It returns
    three empty lists when `bifs` declares no crossing, and asks no requirement
    for a form until `das` holds a real assumption row. The rules it composes
    are public and callable alone: `assumption_row_findings(das, bifs)` returns
    failures, `surrogate_findings(surs, das, exts, bifs)`,
    `sr_classification_advisories(srs, das)` and `sr_form_findings(srs)`
    return `(failures, advisories)`, and `uncited_assumption_advisories(das,
    srs)` and `no_falsifier_advisories(das)` return advisories. Two data reads
    ride the same seam: `da_citing_srs(srs)` maps each cited assumption id to
    the requirement ids citing it, and `classify_srs(srs, das)` maps each
    requirement id to one of `SR_CLASSES`. A row whose id ends `-000` is the
    template's example and is never judged.
    Two reach reports ride the same seam as advisories, composed by the checker
    beside the tier: `assumption_reach_advisories(das, srs, needs, stks, exts,
    bifs, surs)`, silent when `bifs` declares no crossing, and
    `need_frame_gap_advisories(needs, stks, srs, bifs, das)`, silent with no
    operation crossing or no agreed stakeholder. `needs` are
    `spine_carrier.load_needs`' rows. `reaching_parties(needs, stks, exts)` is
    their data read: each need id mapped to the set of entities a crossing
    must belong to in order to reach it.

Contract IF-200: the observation test declaration's rules `trace.py` imports.
    Rows in, findings out, with no I/O. `observation_tc_findings(tcs)` returns
    `(failures, advisories)`: the failures join the always-on
    `--strict-integrity` floor and the advisories ride the warn pipe, each
    naming its row. It applies whatever the frame declares. Two reads ride the
    same seam: `is_observation_tc(tc)`, true when the `Automated` cell reads
    No, and `sampling_model_declared(tc)`, true only for a sampled case whose
    sample size and acceptance rule are both valid. A `-000` row is never
    judged.
Contract IF-201: the one derivation of an assumption's citing requirements,
    `da_citing_srs(srs) -> {assumption id: [requirement ids]}` in row order,
    read by the stage derivation and the red-TC census. Pure over requirement
    rows in the carrier's column names; a `-000` row contributes nothing, and a
    requirement citing no assumption appears nowhere in the map.

Contract IF-208: the tier's two pointer rules that land in OTHER classes, which
    `trace.py` imports beside the tier entry point and composes itself. Rows in,
    findings out, on the same terms as IF-190. `interface_bridge_findings(ifs,
    das)` returns `(failures, advisories)` over boundary interfaces alone
    (a from- or to-external tie-back): the failures, a `BridgedBy` entry naming
    an undeclared assumption, join the interface class and `--strict`'s exit
    code; the advisories, a boundary interface with neither `BridgedBy` nor
    `Coincident`, ride the warn pipe. Both are empty until `das` holds a real
    assumption row. `obstacle_hat_findings(das, hat_names)` returns failures,
    each an `ObstacleHats` entry the roster names in `hat_names` do not hold,
    joining the dangling-hat class; an empty `hat_names` means no roster, so
    every named perspective fails. Neither waits for a declared crossing.
Contract IF-216: the observation results and what they evidence, the rules
    `trace.py` composes and the writer's one policy read. Rows and already-read
    inputs in, findings and readings out, with no I/O, no git and no clock but
    the `now` handed in. `observation_evidence_findings(srs, das, tcs, needs,
    bifs, *, records, raw_files, suite_proof, digests, views, now=None,
    gate=False)` returns `(integrity, advisories)`: every record file that is
    not a whole record or that its case does not allow joins the integrity
    floor, naming the file, with or without a frame; where the frame declares
    a crossing, the approved-but-unevidenced assumptions, the falsification
    worklist and each reopened accepted risk ride the warn pipe. Its rules are
    public: `record_policy_problem(tid, tc, observed_at, expires)` (the
    writer's refusal and the checker's finding, one statement),
    `observation_record_findings`, `tier_covers`, `result_current`,
    `evidence_level` (one of `EVIDENCE_LEVELS`), `evidence_level_advisories`,
    `falsification_worklist` and `accepted_risk_state` (one of `RISK_COVERED`,
    `RISK_UNPROVEN`, `RISK_EVIDENCED`, with its reasons). `suite_proof` is the
    harness's evidence record as `{"outcome", "tier", "bound"}` or None, and a
    view is `baseline_snapshot.risk_acceptance_view`'s dict.
Contract IF-226: the chain the approval brief renders for one assumption or
    surrogate, read by `trace.py`'s brief. `assumption_chain(da_id, reg)`
    returns a dict, or None for an id the registry does not declare, and reads
    no file: `reg` maps `srs`, `needs`, `das`, `surs`, `exts`, `bifs`, `tcs`
    and the evidence inputs `records`, `suite_proof`, `digests` and `now` to
    what the caller already read, a missing key reading as empty. An
    assumption's chain carries `citing` as `(id, title, requirement)`, `needs`
    as `(id, need)`, `landing` as `(crossing, entity, name)`, `cases`, `level`
    (one of `EVIDENCE_LEVELS`), `falsifier` and, for a fidelity assumption,
    `surrogate`, that surrogate's chain; a surrogate's carries `emulates` as
    `(id, name)` and `named_by` as `(id, assumption)`. Both carry `row`, the
    row itself.

# automated half of those results is the harness's whole-suite evidence record;
# the observation half is one file per result (`kitlib.observation`). The rules
# below judge those files against the cases they name, derive from them how
# well each assumption is evidenced, list what relies on an assumption shown
# false, and read whether an accepted risk still covers one. Every input that
# lives on disk or in git arrives already read: `record_observation.evidence_inputs`
# reads the records, the suite's record, the declared inputs' digests and each
# accepted risk's act, once, and `trace.main` hands them here.

# THE EVIDENCE LEVELS (SR-200), weakest first. `assumed`: no test case names
# the assumption, so nothing could evidence it. `specified`: a case does, but
# none has a current passing result. `monitored`: a current passing result
# from an automated case or an observation read continuously in operation.
# `sampled`: a current passing result from a sampled observation. A sampled
# pass is the weaker of the two positive levels, since a passed sparse sample
# bounds discovery rather than showing the assumption holds, so where both
# are current the level reads monitored.
