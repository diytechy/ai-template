"""THE FRAME AND NEED-TIER RULES — pure joins over the depth-0 frame's rows.

The sibling of `coherence.py`, and built the same way: every rule here is a
JOIN ACROSS ROWS, it reads no file, and `trace.analyze` composes it and stays
its only caller. `trace.py` is held to an exact size ratchet, so a new rule
family lands here and `trace.py` grows by the composition lines alone (spine
map D21).

What lives here is the frame's own vocabulary about SYSTEMS OF INTEREST. A frame
can hold two: the system in OPERATION, and the system that builds and DELIVERS
it (`kitlib.spine.SYSTEM_VALUES`). Each boundary crossing names which one it
belongs to (SR-187), and a requirement's system is DERIVED from the crossings
its `Boundary-Refs` name (SR-219), recomputed on every run and never written
back to the requirement.

The NEED TIER's joins onto the frame live here too. The needs file carries a
short STAKEHOLDER LIST beside its needs, naming who owns an outcome and which
declared entity of the frame they are (`party`), and each need names its
stakeholders (SR-189). A need may also point at the document it was drawn from
(`source`, SR-190). Whether that document and its anchor exist is a filesystem
question, so `trace.main` reads the anchors and hands them in, and the rule here
only compares.

Rows are the carrier's column-keyed dicts (`B-ID`, `System`, `SR-ID`,
`Boundary-Refs`, `STK-ID`, `Party`, `EXT-ID`), exactly as
`trace.load_registries` hands them over, except the needs, which arrive from
`spine_carrier.load_needs` with lower-case keys and their id under `id`. Every
function returns plain finding strings, per `trace.frame_findings`' note on the
pair shape.

Stdlib only. A plain sibling of `scripts/`, not a `kitlib` module, for the
reason `coherence.py` records: these are the checker's rules, and the
scaffolder has no business importing them.

Contracts: IF-180 — the seam this module declares (process.md §8; row of record
in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-180: the frame and need-tier rule surface `trace.py` imports. Rows
    in, findings out, and nothing else: no I/O, no git, no filesystem, no argv.
    `frame_system_findings(bifs)` returns `(failures, advisories)`: the
    failures join the frame class and `trace.py --strict`'s exit code, the
    advisories ride the warn pipe and never join a failure set.
    `sr_system_advisories(srs, bifs)` returns warn-only advisories, and
    `crossing_systems(bifs)` returns a crossing-id to system map.
    `stakeholder_findings(sn_needs, stks, exts)` returns `(failures,
    advisories)` on the same two pipes. `source_documents(sn_needs)` returns
    the sorted documents the needs' `source` cells name, and
    `need_source_findings(sn_needs, anchors)` returns gating failures, where
    `anchors` maps each of those documents to the set of anchors it exposes, or
    to None when it is not a file in the repository. Rows are the carrier's
    column-keyed dicts (the needs: `load_needs`' lower-case keys), and no
    function writes to a row it is handed.
    `mediation_findings(exts)` returns gating failures: an entity's `Mediates`
    naming an undeclared entity or the entity itself.
