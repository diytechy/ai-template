"""Derive the EFFECTIVE STAGE from artifact states and cache it to `docs/stage`.

Stack-agnostic, standard-library only. This is the stage axis's own producer
(WI-498 slice 1, ruled plan `docs/plans/2026-08-21-stage-unification-plan.md`
§§1-3). It is now the ONLY derived-state producer: the transitional dual state
this module was born beside ended at slice 5, when `docs/gate` was deleted, its
`derive_gate.py` became the import-only `spine_rules.py`, and the retired axis's
one surviving CLI (`--next-phase`) was rehomed HERE — so the printed number and
the recorded `phase =` field are derived from the same rows by the same rule.

WHAT THIS ADDED THAT THE RETIRED `docs/gate` DID NOT HAVE.

1. **A per-phase stage.** `spine_stage` took no phase argument and `_per_phase`
   folded BARS, so "the current phase's stage" did not exist — the sharpest gap
   the deep-check found (Q2(iv)). It exists here.
2. **A draft-excluded reading.** `ex-draft=` is a bar and validating it against
   the stage ladder would type-check and return a wrong ordinal (Q2(v-d),
   refuted as a shortcut), so the counterfactual is computed here on its own axis.
   This is what stops one ordinary Drafted row from dropping a mature repo to
   what a fresh scaffold reads — C-01 on the new axis.
3. **A floor.** The bar axis floors at DevStg-Reqs and the stage axis did not, so
   the stage could reach ord 0, below every runnable rung. Under the at-or-above
   selection slice 2 lands, that is a repo where nothing runs and the run goes
   green because of it.
4. **A fingerprint of the declared inputs**, which is what lets any reader tell a
   current record from a stale one without parsing the registries.

THE DIVISION OF LABOUR. The pure half — the input list, the fingerprint, the file
format, the ordering, the floor and the fold — is `kitlib/stage.py`, because
`kitlib` may not import a sibling and the registry parse cannot go there. This
module is the half that needs the carrier: it loads the spine through
`spine_rules.load_spine`, groups the rows by phase, and calls `spine_rules`'s own
rung predicates so that the two axes can never disagree about what a Drafted row
is. When slice 3 re-discriminates the ladder it edits ONE fall-through
(`spine_rules.spine_stage`) and both files follow.

Contracts: IF-050, IF-165 — the interface seams this module declares
(process.md §8; rows of record in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-050: the derived stage RECORD at `docs/stage`. A plain run writes the
    effective rung, its ordinal, the unfloored settled and live readings, the
    per-phase and per-phase-live breakdowns, the drafted count and a SHA-256
    FINGERPRINT of the declared derivation inputs, one `key = value` per line
    under a comment header. Every field is addressed BY NAME, so a reordered
    record can never hand a reader the wrong value. The fingerprint is the
    contract for the two reading postures: a selection or approval consumer
    reads through `kitlib.stage.read_stage`, which recomputes the fingerprint
    and trusts the recorded values only on a match, deriving fresh in memory
    otherwise, so none can act on a stale rung; a render leaf parses the
    committed record as it stands, so the page and the file it cites describe
    one commit. The record is DERIVED and never hand-set: it moves by approving
    artifacts in a reviewed commit, and a hand-edited or cross-ladder value
    raises rather than reading as a rung.
Contract IF-165: the verdict every arm of this CLI answers in, 0 and 1 alone.
    `--check` returns 1 on an ABSENT `docs/stage` and on a record the recompute
    no longer reproduces, and 0 both on a record that still holds and on a file
    carrying no stage field — the scaffold placeholder, never derived and stale
    relative to nothing. The write run, `--print` and `--next-phase` return 0
    having done their work; `--phase-rule` returns 0 on a warned finding and 1
    only under `--strict`.

    LOWER one. Both readings of "the scope moved" satisfy it; quietly adding
    regressing work to the phase you are standing in does not.

    THE ATTRIBUTED SET IS EVERY STAGE-AFFECTING INPUT, not the spine tiers
    alone (`_ATTRIBUTED_ROWS`, widened at the WI-498 close). A frame row has no
    phase to tag, so its finding reports the decrease and names the cause
    instead of demanding a cell the row cannot carry.

    WHY THIS SHAPE AND NOT A STORED COUNTER (plan §4, alternative (ii) rejected):
    phase stays a pure function of the registries. The derived `phase=` still
    increments BECAUSE the rows say so, so there is no second phase concept to
    drift against the row tags, and `docs/stage` records the derived value
    exactly as `docs/gate` did.

    WARN TIER, AND THE ARMING PATH IS THE POINT. This returns findings; `main`
    prints them and exits 0 unless `--strict`. New rules arm warn-first here
    unless a ruling says otherwise, and OI-51's ruling establishes that the rule
    EXISTS, not that it hard-fails on day one. It promotes by being wired into
    `check.py`'s `--strict` trio at a threshold — deliberately NOT done in this
    slice, because a rule whose fire has never been observed on real authoring
    should not be able to block a commit. The promotion is one call-site edit:
    the predicate and its vocabulary do not change (`trace.schema_advisories`'s
    warn-first twin idiom).

    DEGRADES SILENTLY WITHOUT GIT, like every other two-tree rule in the kit: no
    HEAD means no before-state, and a rule that cannot see the past has nothing
