"""hats.py — the HATS ROSTER reader: which declared expert perspectives apply to
a decomposition, and the block a brief embeds so the session has to face them.

Stack-agnostic, standard-library only (Python 3.11+, Windows/POSIX).

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (SN-036, ruled at OI-19 on 2026-08-13). SN-036 requires
that a need turned into detailed requirements is examined from every relevant
expert and downstream-user perspective. Before this module those roles lived in
prose and column headers and had NO mechanical existence at all: nothing put a
perspective to a decomposition, and nothing could say whether one had ever been
applied. The roster (`docs/requirements/hats.toml`) declares the perspectives;
this module decides which of them a given decomposition must face; the brief
composer embeds their questions. That is the INJECTION half. The per-decomposition
RECORD half of SN-036's acceptance — which hats were applied and what each
produced — is DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT HERE: injection alone already changes what
a decomposition produces, while a record built first would be a form to fill in
with nothing behind it (OI-19's sequencing). Nothing gates on a hat today.

ABSENT IS OPT-OUT, MALFORMED IS A REFUSAL. An adopter who deletes the roster
gets composers that proceed without hats — the roster is a layer, not a floor.
A roster that EXISTS and does not parse, or carries a row missing a required
key, or an `applies_when` this module cannot evaluate, raises `HatsError`: a
broken roster reported as an empty one is a decomposition that silently faced
no perspective at all, which is the most expensive way for this machinery to be
wrong. (The same absent-vs-malformed split `spine_carrier.load` draws for the
spine registries.)

`applies_when` IS A CLOSED GRAMMAR, NOT PROSE — because a condition a composer
cannot evaluate is a comment:

    always
    scope == "template"          scope != "this-repo"
    kind == "core"               kind != "draft"
    tags contains "unattended"

Clauses join with `or` OR with `and`; MIXING THEM IN ONE EXPRESSION IS REFUSED,
so no reader ever has to guess a precedence the author did not write. The split
is on the bare keywords, so a VALUE containing ` or ` / ` and ` breaks its
clause and the roster refuses — loudly, naming the clause, which is the right
trade for not carrying a quote-aware tokenizer for values that are tags and
enum words. Scalar
fields (`scope`, `kind`) take `==` / `!=` only; the list field (`tags`) takes
`contains` only — an operator that would need a defined answer for "a list
equals a word" never parses. And the rule that keeps the roster honest as it
ships to projects whose registries carry different facts:

    A FIELD THE COMPOSER DID NOT DECLARE SATISFIES NO CONDITION.

An undeclared fact is not a true one, and it is not a false one either — so
`scope != "template"` over a context with no `scope` is FALSE, not true. A hat
keyed on a fact this project does not yet record stays silent rather than
firing on every decomposition; the fix is to declare the fact (or edit the
roster), never to let the absence read as a match.

WHY tomllib DIRECTLY AND NOT `spine_carrier`. The carrier owns the SPINE's
vocabulary — a stated key->column map, the id-column tier table, and the
migrate_carrier inverse that `tests/test_rule_sync.py` pins. The roster shares
none of it: its rows are keyed by NAME rather than by a numeric id space, it
has three keys of its own, and it is not a tier anything traces through.
Registering it there would grow the map every spine reader consults for a
registry none of them read. Forty lines of `tomllib` here is the smaller change.

Usage (the CLI is a documentation aid; the module is library-first):

    python scripts/hats.py [--root .] list
    python scripts/hats.py [--root .] applicable [--scope S] [--kind K] [--tag T]...
    python scripts/hats.py [--root .] audit [--strict]

(`--root` is the shared option and precedes the subcommand — it was written the
other way round here until the `audit` command was added and the usage line was
run.)

# `render`/`ui`; here that pair is `always`), so a need deliberately tagged to
# read correctly under BOTH carries a token the instance roster never names.
# Reporting that as a typo would be a false alarm on a documented divergence —
# so the tokens join the KNOWN universe, and the audit says which of them reach
# nothing here. Absent paths contribute nothing (`load` returns `[]` for a file

# Tag tokens that DELIBERATELY route to nothing, with the reason each does.

# When a charter is ruled UNCONDITIONAL, the tag it used to key on stops being
# evaluable anywhere: `applies_when = "always"` carries no clause, so the token
# leaves the known universe entirely — it is not in this roster and not in a
# companion one either. The need row keeps the tag, because the tag was always
# two things at once (routing AND subject metadata) and only the routing half
# went away. Left alone, the audit's typo check would report exactly the rows
# whose lens is now MOST reachable, which is the opposite of what that finding
# means; and the roster cannot say so itself, because a hat has three keys and
# none of them is "the tag I used to answer to".
#
# So the retirements are named here, each with the ruling behind it. They stay
