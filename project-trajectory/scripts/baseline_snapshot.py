"""baseline_snapshot.py — the `last_approved` snapshot: what the spine looked
like when a human last blessed it.

Stack-agnostic, standard-library only (Python 3.11+, Windows/POSIX).

WHY THIS EXISTS (owner directive 2026-08-15; design:
docs/plans/2026-08-15-baseline-snapshot-design.md). Every "has this attested row
changed?" question in the kit used to be answered by DERIVING a baseline from
git — `trace._attested_baseline` walked the registry's history for the newest
commit at which the row read `Verified` (now `Approved`). That derivation is correct only while
every amendment flips its row's Status in the same commit, and D-9 deletes the
flip: under the new ladder an approved row STAYS approved while its text is
amended, so the newest-approved revision is HEAD and the diff is empty BY
CONSTRUCTION. The brief would return a clean bill forever, at exit 0, on exactly
the rows a sitting exists to judge.

So the baseline moves OUT of git history and onto disk: when an approval lands,
the registries are COPIED, byte for byte, into `docs/archive/last_approved/`.
Every comparison — the adjudicator, the human re-attest read, the HTML
generators — diffs the live registries against that copy. No hashes, no anchor
columns, no commit-id walk. The baseline becomes something a human can open in
an editor and diff with `git diff`, which is itself an argument for the design.

THREE PROPERTIES DO THE WORK, and each is worth stating because each replaces a
piece of machinery that no longer needs to exist:

  1. **Whole files, never extracted rows.** The copy is byte-for-byte, so
     "snapshot file == live file at the copy commit" is a DECIDABLE property —
     `check_trajectory.staged_snapshot_findings` is the guard that makes a
     hand-edited or partial snapshot fail loudly. Row extraction would destroy
     that, would re-serialise TOML (normalising away comments and authored
     ordering, which is the whole reason `intake._flip_status_lines` exists),
     and would silently drop the normative prose that lives OUTSIDE the rows.
  2. **The snapshot keeps each row's own `Status` cell.** That is what makes
     the UNANCHORED rule decidable: a live row claiming approval whose snapshot
     copy reads *below* approval is an approval that never rode a copy — the
     precise laundering this mechanism exists to catch.
  3. **Vacuous by absence, never by silence.** No directory means "this repo
     has approved nothing yet", which is honest and free for a fresh adopter.
     But once the directory exists, a missing registry INSIDE it is an error,
     and a snapshot file that does not parse RAISES rather than reading as
     empty — `{}` and `None` are opposite claims, and the empty one means
     "re-bless everything with no diff shown".

REPO-RELATIVE PATHS ARE PRESERVED UNDER THE SNAPSHOT ROOT
(`<root>/docs/archive/last_approved/docs/requirements/...`). `spine_carrier`'s
`resolve`/`carriers`/`stem` all take a registry path, so `snapshot_root / rel`
reuses every existing resolver verbatim, carrier fallback included. Flattening
would need a second path vocabulary and would give the resolver nothing to
resolve.

WHY `docs/archive/` IS THE RIGHT HOME, despite "archive is design history, not
a working surface": the placement is ACTIVELY load-bearing.
`check_vocab.EXEMPT_GLOBS` exempts `docs/archive/*`, and the snapshot
legitimately holds the PREVIOUS vocabulary — so anywhere else would red the
vocabulary enforcer on every signing. `check_docs._in_archive` exempts it from
orphan/stale findings and `check_doc_refs.RECORD_PREFIXES` keeps its inherited
citations from dangling. `check_trajectory.ARCHIVE_SPECS_DIR` already reads
archive as live machinery input, so the class is not new.

STATUS OF THIS MODULE, 2026-08-20: LIVE AND ARMED. It shipped reader-first and
advisory (2026-08-15) with every function vacuous by absence; the owner's
signing act seeded `docs/archive/last_approved/` in the post-rename vocabulary
(migration step 6), and step 7 promoted `unanchored_findings` to an
INTEGRITY-class ERROR on the always-on `--strict-integrity` floor plus the
pre-commit hook. The order was the safety property, not ceremony: run against a
pre-seed snapshot (there was none) or a pre-rename one (it spoke the retired
vocabulary), this rule reds every row in the repo, and a check that reds
everything is a check that gets switched off. It stays VACUOUS BY ABSENCE for a
repo that has approved nothing, which is a fresh adopter's honest state.

VOCABULARY NOTE — THE TRANSITIONAL MAPPING IS GONE (D-9 step 5, 2026-08-15).
This module was written against `Approved` before the value existed, and read
the two pre-rename values that together carried the claim (`Verified` and
`Planned`). Step 5 renamed both into `Approved`, so the spine arm of
`_claims_approval` collapsed to the single value its own docstring promised —
deleted, not re-keyed. THE SKEW THIS LEAVES IS REAL AND IS THE DESIGN'S §B6
axis 3: a snapshot copied BEFORE the rename speaks the retired words and would
read as unanchored everywhere, which is why the snapshot is ONE GENERATION,
replaced wholesale at each signing and never migrated in place, and why the
first seed happens AFTER the rename (step 6) and the UNANCHORED rule is armed
only after that (step 7).

Contracts: IF-123, IF-124, IF-125, IF-126, IF-217, IF-220 — the seams this module
declares (process.md §8; rows of record in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-123: the `last_approved` baseline, write side and whole read side.
    `copy_live(root, seed=False, approves=None, reattests=None, verdict=None)`
    mirrors ONLY
    the registries an act authorises byte-for-byte into
    `docs/archive/last_approved/` — the seed copies the whole tree once, a
    refresh copies the registry a `Status` move happened in, every registry
    `approves` names and every registry holding a row `reattests` names, and
    leaves the rest byte-identical to what they were (WI-571: the whole-tree
    copy re-sealed off-spine drift on every spine-only approval). It deletes
    any other-carrier copy of the same stem for a registry it copies, and
    returns the sorted repo-relative paths written. It REFUSES to create the
    directory without `seed=True`, and refuses a refresh while any row of a
    registry it would copy has approved text drifted from its recorded copy (a
    recorded approved row deleted from live counts, as REMOVED) and is neither
    flipped by the act nor named in `reattests` — ROW BY ROW, so naming a
    registry in `approves` clears none of its rows — because the copy it takes
    is the text a signature blesses. That refusal judges THIS ACT'S
    WRITE SET and not the whole ledger, so an approval is not blocked by drift
    in a registry the copy leaves alone; an act whose write set is empty is
    judged over the whole ledger, so a refresh that would copy nothing in a
    drifted tree refuses rather than exiting 0 in silence. It lists every such
    row and cell, uncapped. `approves` is `{registry rel: ref}`
    (`parse_approves` builds it from a `REGISTRY=REF` CLI value) and `reattests`
    a set of row ids (`parse_reattests`, from comma-joined ids of the
    `SNAPSHOT_TIERS` tiers); `verdict` is the repo path of the verdict file
    that ruled the re-attested rows, refused without `reattests` or when no
    such file is in the tree. Before every copy, a seed included, an id naming
    neither a live row nor a recorded one is refused, and so is any id at all
    on a first signing, which copies the whole tree and writes no stamp. The
    refs and re-attested ids land in the snapshot's prose stamp, every act that
    copied a registry appends its entry to the act ledger (IF-220), and
    `act_summary` is the one line the CLI prints for the act. `load_all(root)`
    parses the snapshot into
    `{(stem, id column): {id: row}}`, returns None — never `{}` — when there is
    no snapshot, and RAISES on a file that exists and will not parse;
    `rows_for` is the ONE place that None collapses to `{}`. `exists`, `stamp`,
    `is_drifted`/`drifted_cells` over approved cells only, and
    `unanchored_findings` complete the read side. Nothing may wire `copy_live`
    into a freshness step: the snapshot is deliberately behind live while an
    amendment is pending, and that lag IS the signal.
Contract IF-124: the anchor read a composed brief takes — `exists`, `stamp` and
    `SNAPSHOT_DIR` — so an amendment is measured against text that is not the
    text under judgement. `exists` answers the vacuous case truthfully rather
    than conveniently: before the first signing there is no anchor at all, and
    the honest response is a held first-approval question, never a before/after
    rendered with an empty before. `stamp` is ADVISORY and derived from git; off
    a checkout it returns empty strings rather than raising, so a missing date
    costs a reader one line and nothing more. Named a registry, it answers for
    that registry's copy alone, because a refresh copies only what its act
    authorises and the directory's newest write is one copy's provenance, not
    every copy's.
Contract IF-125: the drift read — `load_all`, `rows_for`, `is_drifted` and
    `SNAPSHOT_DIR`, and never `copy_live`. Drift is asked only of a row that
    CLAIMS approval-or-above and is present in the snapshot; a row below
    approval answers False because it has made no claim to fall from, and a
    claiming row absent from the snapshot answers False because that is the
    harder unanchored finding, owned elsewhere. With no snapshot `load_all`
    returns None and `rows_for` collapses it to `{}`, so a reader reports
    nothing approved rather than everything drifted.
Contract IF-126: the stamp read — `registry_stamps(root)` and `SNAPSHOT_DIR`
    — so a generated surface can name WHICH baseline the reader is being shown
    and where it lives: each registry the record holds a committed copy of,
    with the commit that last wrote THAT copy, since a refresh copies only what
    its act authorises and the copies were written at different commits. Advisory and read-only in both directions: the stamp is
    derived from git and degrades to empty strings off a checkout, and this side
    never calls `copy_live`, because a generator that refreshed the baseline
    would erase the very lag it exists to report.
Contract IF-217: the accepted risk's anchor, read from history.
    `risk_acceptance_act(root, da_id)` returns `(commit, reason)`: the latest
    commit whose approval act names the assumption — an act ledger entry that
    commit added listing it approved or re-attested (IF-220) — while the
    record's copy of the row there carries a non-empty `accepted_risk`; where no act names the row at
    all, the first commit at which its live `accepted_risk` took its current
    value. `(None, reason)` when no anchor can be read: history too shallow
    (the repository is a shallow clone and the window holds no such act), acts
    naming the row with no risk recorded, a value in no commit yet, or no git.
    `risk_acceptance_view(root, da_id)` adds what the pure rule
    (`assumption_rules.accepted_risk_state`) compares, as a dict: `act`,
    `reason`, and at that commit the `assumption` row, the requirement rows
    `srs`, the `needs` keyed by id and the `known` observation record names.
    Read-only; no clock is read, and ancestry, not a timestamp, orders a record.
Contract IF-220: the act ledger, `ACTS` under `SNAPSHOT_DIR`. A TOML file of
    `[[act]]` entries, one appended by each `copy_live` that copied a registry
    (the seed included) and none by an act that copied nothing: `seq`, an
    integer one above the highest already present, so identical acts stay
    distinct; `date`, the ISO day; `approved`, the sorted ids of the compared
    tiers' rows the act carried into approval (a live row claiming approval
    whose prior recorded copy did not, or that the record did not hold), the
    needs file's need and stakeholder tiers among them (`NEED_TIERS`); and
    `reattested`, the sorted ids its `reattests` named; and, only when the act
    named one, `verdict`, the verdict file that ruled those rows — the record a
    held rung's CLARITY re-attestation carries (OI-100, WI-791). FAILS CLOSED:
    `acts_problems(text)` lists every fault (text that does not parse, a field
    missing or mistyped, an id not of the kit's syntax, a `verdict` that is
    not a non-empty string, `seq` values not
    unique and increasing in file order), and `parse_acts(text)` returns the
    entries as dicts in file order, `[]` for no text, or raises
    `ActLedgerError` — it never returns the entries it could read.
    `read_acts(root)` reads the working tree's; `acts_findings(root)` reports
    its faults as integrity findings, which `record_findings(root)` joins to
    the unanchored ones for `trace.py --strict-integrity`; a
    snapshot act on a malformed ledger is refused before it moves any byte of
    the record, and `risk_acceptance_act` reads no anchor through one. The
    README beside it stays prose; nothing parses it.

# same rows on the same day are two entries and the later one is never read as
# the earlier. Appended by `copy_live`, read by `risk_acceptance_act`; it

#
# **THE OFF-SPINE HALF IS COPIED AND, IN THIS REPO TODAY, COMPARED BY NO RULE**
# (2026-08-20, the batch review's MINOR-13, measured: 130 of 534 snapshotted rows
# are IF/CMP and every one of them reads `Drafted`). That is not a defect and it
# is not a gap to close: both `is_drifted` and `unanchored_findings` ask their
# question only of rows that CLAIM approval, and a row below approval has made no
# claim to fall from. So the protection those tiers get is currently ZERO, and it
# begins — with no code change at all — at their first approval. The copy is
# taken at the SEED so that the day a human moves one of those cells, the
# record of what they blessed already exists to compare against. Stated here
# because "we snapshot the off-spine tiers" reads like live protection, and for
# one more registry-approval cycle it is not.
#
# SCOPED SINCE WI-571: after the seed, an off-spine registry's snapshot copy is
# refreshed ONLY when a `Status` cell moves in it (a human approval — the exact
# event this baseline exists to record), `--approves` names it or `--reattests`
# names one of its rows. A spine-only approval no longer re-copies these files,
# so it can no longer re-seal whatever off-spine drift happened to be live at
# that moment.

    traced-cell refresh moves it while approving nothing. The provenance question
    a brief's reader is asking is "when did an approval last happen here", and
    the only mechanical trace of an approval is a `status` line moving in a
    registry the snapshot covers.

    `-G` over the status-line regex rather than `-S`: a pickaxe on the STRING
    counts occurrences, and an approval changes a status line's VALUE without
    changing how many there are, so `-S` is blind to exactly the commit being
    looked for. `-G` matches the added/removed lines of the diff, where BOTH
    sides of a maturity edit land — the removed line carrying the old value and
    the added line carrying the new one.

    field of a row line that changes for a dozen unrelated reasons. So this

    below. `absorbed` is the approved text a copy would silently re-bless: rows
    whose SNAPSHOT copy claims approval (that is the record that would be
    overwritten) whose approved cells have moved, OR which the live registry no
    longer carries at all. `flips` is the authorising act — an existing row that
    crossed into an approval claim in the reviewed commit, which authorises THAT
    row and no other (SR-207). A reverse Status move is a de-approval, not
    authority to re-bless anything. Tiers that share a file share one entry,
    because the file is the unit the copy moves.

    A REMOVED ROW IS ABSORBED TOO, keyed by the single pseudo-cell
    `ROW_REMOVED`. The copy is the whole file, so refreshing it after a recorded
    approved row was deleted drops the text a human blessed from the record as
    surely as rewriting it would — and a ledger that walked the live rows alone
    could not see a row that is not there, so a flip elsewhere in the file
    carried the deletion in unnamed. The recorded rows are walked as well, and a
    whole registry file deleted from live reads as every one of its rows removed.
    No flip can clear a removal (there is no row left to flip); naming the row
    in `--reattests` is how an act blesses it.

    A FLIPPED ROW'S OWN AMENDMENT IS NEVER ABSORBED: amend-plus-flip is the
    sanctioned shape of a re-approval (`test_the_amendment_seam_is_BLIND_to_an_
    amend_plus_flip` explains why no diff-based seam can see it), so the flip is
    recorded and the row leaves the absorbed set.

    Rows the snapshot does not carry are not here at all — an approval with no
    copy is UNANCHORED, a louder finding `unanchored_findings` owns. Rows below
    approval in the record are not here either: a `Drafted` row's text was never

    authorised — THE AUTHORITY CHECK THE WRITER SHIPPED WITHOUT (adversarial
    round, 2026-08-20: ROUND-OPUS CRITICAL-2 / ROUND-SOL CRITICAL-1).

    The hole was exact and was executed end to end: `copy_live` refused only to
    CREATE the directory, so once a repo had signed, `intake.py snapshot`
    re-blessed whatever text happened to be in the tree. Two commits — rewrite an
    Approved requirement, then refresh — left every check green with the record
    rewritten to match, and the drift the mechanism exists to render had been
    absorbed into the baseline.

    DECIDED ROW BY ROW (SR-207). The act is refused while any row of a registry
    it would copy has approved text drifted from its recorded copy and the act
    does not itself bless that row (`_unattested_rows`). A row is blessed in one
    of three ways, and the first two need no flag at all:

      1. **It absorbs nothing approved.** Traced-cell refreshes (a `Module`,
         `CodeSymbol`, `TestRefs` or ref pointer re-point) and Drafted-row work
         stay exactly as cheap as they were — this is the common case, and the
         review verified the WI-482/WI-452 class of the same day was clean.
      2. **Its own `Status` moved into approval.** Amend-plus-flip is approval:
         a human moved THAT row's maturity cell in the reviewed commit the copy
         rides. It blesses that row and no other.
      3. **`--reattests <ROW-ID>` names it.** The escape for the shape the ladder
         genuinely has — an amendment to an Approved row that a sitting ruled
         without moving its Status (the D-9 ladder's own case, and what the
         2026-08-20 17-cell amendment batch was). The ids land in the snapshot's
         prose stamp, so the record says which rows the act re-read.

    `--approves <registry>=<ref>` NAMES THE ACT AND CLEARS NO ROW. It still puts
    its registry in the act's scope and records the ref — a HUMAN's citation of
    the sitting, log fragment or commit, not validated because nothing can
    validate it. What it no longer does is pass the registry's drift: the record
    is a copy of the whole file, so refreshing it for one row copies every row
    as it stands, and a registry-wide pass let one row's approval silently bless
    another row's unreviewed edit. Before WI-571 a bare `--approves` muted the
    gate for all seven files; WI-571 narrowed it to the one registry it names;
    SR-207 narrows it to none.

    PER ROW RATHER THAN PER REGISTRY, reversing the choice this docstring used to
    defend — that a row-level pairing would demand a flip for each amended row,
    which is the flip the D-9 ladder deleted. `--reattests` names a row without
    flipping it, so the row-level rule costs no flip. And it holds for any
    number of tiers in one file: `external.toml`'s three tiers share one ledger
    entry, so one tier's approval can no longer carry another tier's drift, and
    a tier added to `SNAPSHOT_TIERS` is covered with no edit here — the needs
    file's needs and stakeholders included (`NEED_TIERS`), so an act copying the
    needs registry is refused while an approved need's text moved unread.
    A recorded approved row deleted from live is absorbed as REMOVED
    (`refresh_ledger`) and cleared only by naming it in `--reattests`. Whether
    each re-attested id names a row at all is `_refuse_reattests`'s question,
    asked before EVERY copy — this gate is skipped on a first signing.

    AND SCOPED TO THE ACT, LIKE THE WRITER (WI-584 ruling (a)). Only registries
    this act would WRITE are judged. WI-571 scoped `copy_live` and left this
    gate global, so a per-registry approval was refused by drift in registries
    the copy would never touch: naming the one registry a sitting ruled listed
    only the ones it did not, under a header claiming nothing authorised the
    act. A registry the write set excludes cannot be absorbed by the act being
    refused, so blocking on it protects nothing — it keeps both its stale bytes
    and its visible drift either way, which is what the re-attestation brief is
    for. A registry reaches the list by being WRITTEN — a flip, a ref, a

    replaced re-sealed whatever off-spine drift was live at the moment of a
    spine-only approval, silently zeroing the off-spine census the snapshot is
    the only basis for. An untouched file is not "written", so both mirror rules
    stay satisfied without touching it.

    Byte-for-byte (`shutil.copyfile`), the LIVE carrier only — and for a registry
    it copies, any OTHER-carrier file for the same stem is DELETED in the same
    act, or `spine_carrier.resolve` raises "exists under BOTH carriers" on the
    very next read of the snapshot. A copied registry with no live carrier is
    skipped and its stale snapshot copies removed; a registry OUTSIDE the act's
    scope is not touched at all.

    **REFUSES to CREATE the directory unless `seed=True`.** That refusal is the
    bootstrap guard: the FIRST snapshot blesses whatever text it copies, so it
    must ride the owner's own reviewed signing commit and nothing else.
    `--seed` is reachable only from `intake.py snapshot --seed`, and
    `tests/test_baseline_snapshot.py` pins that no loop module, hook or
    `check.py` contains the flag.

    **AND REFUSES TO REFRESH ONE WITHOUT AUTHORITY** (`refresh_refusal`, 2026-08-20).
    Creating was guarded and rewriting was not, which made the second act the
    cheap one: after the first signing this function re-blessed any text it was
    pointed at. Since SR-207 a refresh that would absorb a row's drifted
    APPROVED text needs that row's own `Status` flip or its id in `reattests`;
    an `approves` ref names the act and its registry and clears no row. Refs and
    re-attested ids are recorded into the snapshot's prose stamp. Traced-cell
    refreshes are unaffected and need no flag. Since WI-584 that gate is scoped
    to THIS act's
    write set, so a per-registry approval is no longer refused by drift in a
    registry the copy leaves alone — with one unscoped arm: an act that would
    copy nothing in a tree carrying drifted approved text is still refused, so
    the laundering attempt meets a message and not a silent exit 0.

    **NOTHING SHOULD EVER WIRE THIS INTO A FRESHNESS STEP.** Exactly two callers
    are sanctioned: `intake._apply_flips` (the mechanical path, called AFTER the
    status write so the copy captures the flip — which is what makes the
    unanchored rule decidable) and `intake.py snapshot` (the human path). Not
    `agent_loop`, not `dispatch`, not the hooks, not `check.py`. A step that
    REGENERATED the snapshot would defeat the whole mechanism: the snapshot is
    deliberately behind live whenever an amendment is pending, and that lag IS
    the signal.

    because the copy is a WHOLE FILE: a live row reading approved whose snapshot
    copy reads `Drafted` is an approval that never rode a copy. Row extraction

    VACUOUS UNTIL THE SNAPSHOT HOLDS A REGISTRY. Once it holds one, a registry
    MISSING from beside it is itself reported here — a half-copied record is a
    record with a hole, which is the state worth being loud about. The one

    copy is written by the act approving its first row, so until a live row of
    it claims approval its absence is not reported, since reporting it would
    demand a copy no act may write.

    The vacuum is "no registry" rather than "no directory", and the distinction
    is not academic: `bootstrap.py` SCAFFOLDS `docs/archive/last_approved/` with
    its README and nothing else, deliberately ("an empty snapshot is the HONEST
    state for a repo that has approved nothing yet"), so a directory test would
    report every tier missing in EVERY fresh adopter repo on day one — the
    reds-everything failure the arming note below exists to avoid, shipped
    downstream. Caught when this producer was first wired to `trace.py`
    (adversarial round 2, 2026-08-15): until then nothing called this, so
    nothing could notice. The deletion half is not lost with it — the mirror
    invariant refuses a registry deleted from a standing record in the commit
    that does it (`check_trajectory.staged_snapshot_findings`).

    **ARMED (migration step 7).** `trace.py` appends these to
    `findings.integrity`, so they fail the always-on `--strict-integrity` floor —
    and the pre-commit hook that runs exactly that command — at every gate.
    INTEGRITY rather than SCHEMA because `--strict-schema` runs at DevStg-Impl
    alone (correction C1): an approval that never rode a copy is wrong at any
    stage, exactly like a duplicated id. Nothing in this producer changed at the
    arming; what moved is the pipe it joins one level up, which is the whole
    value of having run it warn-first since step 4 — the promotion was a one-line
    change to a rule already proven quiet, not a rule nobody had seen fire.
