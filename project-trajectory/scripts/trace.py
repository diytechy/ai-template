"""Traceability join + orphan report for the SN->SR->LLR->TC registries.

Stack-agnostic reference implementation (Python 3, standard library only — no
pip installs). Drop it in a new repo as `scripts/trace.py` and wire it into the
check harness / CI. It is the generated "traceability matrix" referenced by
PROCESS.md: it never needs hand-maintaining.

Usage:
    python scripts/trace.py [--strict] [--strict-integrity] [--require-verified]
                            [--phase LIST] [--no-placeholders] [--strict-schema]
                            [--html] [--root DIR] [--docs DIR]

Reads (relative to --docs, default "<root>/docs"; --root defaults to "."):
    requirements/system-requirements.csv   (cols: SR-ID, SN-Refs, Verification, Status, ...)
    requirements/low-level-requirements.csv (cols: LLR-ID, SR-Refs, ...)
    test/test-cases.csv                     (cols: TC-ID, Verifies, ...)
    requirements/stakeholder-needs.md       (optional; SN-### ids scraped for SN->SR coverage)
    requirements/performance-budgets.csv    (optional; PB-### perf/resource budgets, §9 —
                                             each row's Refs must back-link a real SR/LLR/Module)
    requirements/modules.csv                 (optional; MOD-### coordinator module registry,
                                             MULTI_REPO.md — each row's DelegatedSRs must name a
                                             real coordinator SR; the multi-repo layer only)
    requirements/procurement.csv             (optional; PART-### purchased/external parts,
                                             process-options.md — each row's IF-Ref names the
                                             owning interface row of record (MULTI_REPO.md §3.3);
                                             integrity-checked only, like a MOD row with no
                                             DelegatedSRs)
    requirements/assets.csv                  (optional; ASSET-### binary/large-asset provenance,
                                             process-options.md "Binary assets" — provenance,
                                             license, attribution, contract link + a pointer/hash;
                                             integrity-checked only, like PART)

Writes:
    test/report.md  — counts, the SR->LLR->TC matrix, the orphan list, and two
        rendered views of the same join: a line-reviewable SN->SR->LLR->TC text
        outline and a small, diff-friendly Mermaid `graph LR` DAG colored by
        orphan/draft state.
    test/report.html (only with --html) — a dependency-free, collapsible
        <details> tree of the full graph (inline CSS, zero JS) that scales to any
        size. A generated composite artifact: gitignored, never the review
        surface — review the registry CSVs (process.md §3 "Reviewability").

Exit code: 0 normally; with --strict, 1 if any orphan (or, with
--require-verified, any status finding) exists — use in gates.

Orphan rules (the method rules are stated once, in process.md §4):
    - SR with no LLR (unless Verification is Analysis/Inspection/Attest — those
      have no code to decompose; Demonstration/Manual SRs still describe behavior
      the software implements, so they keep the LLR requirement. Attest is the
      human-attestation kind — a named person's recorded judgment, often over a
      subjective/binary asset with no code symbol, so it is LLR-exempt too)
    - SR with no TC (every SR needs ≥1 TC row regardless of method; for human
      methods the TC records the procedure with Automated=No)
    - SR with no SN link (only when stakeholder-needs.md provides real SN ids —
      the G1 "every SR links ≥1 SN" criterion, machine-checked)
    - LLR with no SR parent, or referencing an unknown SR
    - LLR with no TC
    - TC that verifies nothing, or references an unknown SR/LLR
    - SN with no SR (only when stakeholder-needs.md is present)
--require-verified adds the G3 status criterion:
    - SR with Verification=Test whose Status is not Verified
--phase scopes that status criterion to a delivery phase (process.md §4
"Phased delivery"): SRs may carry an optional `Phase` column (e.g. v1, v2);
`--phase v1` (or a cumulative list, `--phase v1,v2`) exempts SRs tagged with
*other* phases from --require-verified and reports them as phase-deferred —
the exemption is explicit, never silent. A blank/absent Phase means the SR is
in scope for every phase. Orphan rules are phase-blind: every SR keeps its
LLR + TC rows regardless of phase.

Always (independent of --strict-schema), structural integrity is checked:
    - a registry CSV data row whose parsed column count differs from its
      header's. An unquoted comma (inside a Permutations set like `set{a,b,c}`
      or a free-text Rationale cell) silently shifts every later column, so the
      DictReader-based join reads misaligned cells for two gates before
      --strict-schema would notice. Checked for EVERY *.csv under
      docs/requirements/ and docs/test/ — spine, off-spine (interfaces,
      procurement, ...), and project-added registries alike — since the check
      needs no knowledge of a file's semantics, only its header
    - a duplicated SR/LLR/TC/PB/MOD id (the join would otherwise silently dedupe it)
    - a malformed id (not "PREFIX-<digits>")
    - a performance-budget row (PB-###, §9) whose Refs name an unknown
      SR/LLR/Module, or that back-links nothing — the budgets registry is off the
      spine but must stay traceable to it (the PB-000 example row is ignored, so
      the optional registry never blocks a gate a project doesn't use)
    - a coordinator module row (MOD-###, MULTI_REPO.md — the multi-repo layer)
      whose DelegatedSRs name an unknown coordinator SR; an external/reused part
      referenced only via the IF-### catalog may delegate nothing, so an empty
      back-link is allowed here (unlike PB). The MOD-000 example row is ignored,
      so the optional registry never blocks a single-repo project's gate
    - a purchased/external part row (PART-###, process-options.md) with a
      malformed/duplicate PART- id. Its IF-Ref names the owning interface row of
      record (MULTI_REPO.md §3.3) but is NOT resolved here: trace.py never reads
      interfaces.csv (the IF-### tier is off the joined spine), so PART is
      integrity-checked only — like a MOD row that delegates nothing. The
      PART-000 example row is ignored, so the optional registry never blocks a gate
    - a binary/large-asset provenance row (ASSET-###, process-options.md "Binary
      assets") with a malformed/duplicate ASSET- id. Off the spine like PART:
      integrity-checked only, its provenance/license/hash tracked in text even
      though the asset itself can't be diffed. The ASSET-000 example row is
      ignored, so the optional registry never blocks a gate
These join `--strict`'s failure set like orphans do. `--strict-integrity` fails
on *only* this integrity class: it is the always-valid floor the pre-commit hook
runs on every commit — a duplicated or malformed id is wrong at any stage, while
orphans are a G2+ *gate* criterion (a mid-G1 registry legitimately has SRs with
no LLR/TC yet, and must still be committable).

--no-placeholders flags any leftover template example row (id ending "-000") as
a finding — wire it in from G2 on (a fresh scaffold is exempt only until you
claim a gate). Without it, "-000" example rows are ignored so a fresh scaffold
starts green.

--strict-schema adds data-quality checks over the real (non-placeholder) rows:
    - required fields are non-empty (SR: SR-ID, Title, SN-Refs, Requirement,
      AcceptanceCriteria, Priority, Verification, Status; LLR: LLR-ID, SR-Refs,
      Title, Module, CodeSymbol, Detail, Status; TC: TC-ID, Verifies, Level,
      Method, Tier, Expected, Automated, Status);
    - the two *closed* vocabularies the method defines (process.md §4) hold:
      SR Verification in {Test, Demonstration, Manual, Analysis, Inspection,
      Attest}, TC Tier in {Smoke, Full, Release}. Priority/Status are deliberately
      NOT enumerated — the method leaves them open (e.g. Priority S, Status
      Planned).

Always (warn-only, never an exit-code change), acceptance-criteria testability
is advised on: a comparative/absolute term in an SR's AcceptanceCriteria
("identical", "indistinguishable", "equivalent", "same as", "matches", ...)
with no pinned predicate nearby in the cell is flagged as a WARNING on stdout
and in the report. A comparative is untestable until it names its predicate —
identical *in what*, judged *how* ("cannot distinguish source by schema" vs
"identical field names and dtypes per IF-003"). The predicate heuristic looks
for pinning markers (i.e./e.g./defined/listed/per/measured/tolerance/golden/
byte-for-byte/byte-identical/bit-identical/== ...), so it is deliberately a
*lint*, not a gate: the G1
consistency review (process.md §4) makes the call, and the reviewer either
pins the predicate or accepts the wording knowingly.

The report always includes a "Verification basis (attested vs mechanized)"
count (process.md §4 "Attest"): of the SRs reported Verified, how many rest on a
runnable check vs a named human's recorded judgment (Verification=Attest). This
keeps the project's trust footprint auditable — attestation is honest but
trust-based (the box can be checked without the work having happened), so the
report never lets it hide inside a bare "Verified".
