"""The requirement spine's registry CARRIER (OI-12 / docs/repo-lock.md D-5).

ONE FILE PER TIER, id-keyed TOML:

    [requirement.SR-137]        # the id PREFIX is retained, and BARE
    title = "One policy home, with a checked shape"
    sn_refs = ["SN-028"]        # refs are typed arrays
    phase = 5                   # ints are ints
    requirement = \"\"\"...\"\"\"       # multi-line strings hold the prose cells

replacing the two carriers the spine shipped with — stakeholder needs as
markdown prose tables, SR/LLR/TC as CSV. `tomllib` is stdlib at the kit's 3.11
floor, and the kit already sanctions TOML in two homes (`docs/process.toml`,
the `+++` frontmatter of every `docs/work/` spec).

WHAT THE CARRIER BUYS THAT A CHECK USED TO. Three integrity rules stop being
code and become properties of the parse: a DUPLICATE ID is a decode error (the
id is the table key, and TOML forbids declaring one twice); a REF LIST is an
array, retiring the split-on-whitespace rule and with it the
`SN-001 and SN-002` -> "`and` is an orphan" defect; an EMPTY CELL is an ABSENT
KEY, so "unset" and "set to empty" stop being the same value.

ROWS COME BACK UNDER TODAY'S COLUMN NAMES (`SR-ID`, `Title`, `SN-Refs`, ...),
which is the whole point of this module existing: the carrier change is data
plus a loader, not a sixteen-module rename braided into a migration. D-3 is the
pass that renames things, and it renames them on this carrier afterwards.

WHY THIS IS A SIBLING MODULE AND NOT ELEVEN COPIES — OWNER RULING 2026-08-10,
AMENDING the F5 ruling that rejected a shared `_kitcommon.py` at WI-078. The F5 rule buys cross-script copy-ability, and it
is a good rule; it was written for small stable PLUMBING (a five-line CSV
loader, the argparse preamble), where a divergence between copies is visible
and cheap. This is not that. Measured before the ruling: two readers need all
28 columns, three need none, and the rest need between 1 and 20 — so the
duplicated form is ~300 lines of VOCABULARY across eleven modules, and its
failure mode is the one this repo keeps finding. A copy that has not learned a
column does not fail loudly; it returns a row with that cell missing, which
every consumer downstream reads as "the cell is empty". That is silent content
loss on the registries the kit exists to make trustworthy.

So the vocabulary gets ONE home and the readers import it. The cost is real and
is paid where it belongs: a kit re-sync copies this file alongside its
importers (ADOPTING.md §6 lists it), exactly as `trace.py` already ships with
`trace_text.py`. "Independently copyable" becomes "copyable with its declared
siblings", which is what the kit already practised and had not yet said.

PURE BY DESIGN, like `trace_text.py`: text in, rows out. No git, no argv, and
the only filesystem it touches is `resolve()`'s existence check — because the
one thing that MUST NOT be duplicated eleven ways is the dual-home refusal.
Every caller does its own reading, so a script keeps deciding its own I/O.

Contracts: IF-102, IF-104, IF-105, IF-106, IF-107, IF-108, IF-109, IF-110, IF-111, IF-112, IF-114, IF-118, IF-119, IF-120, IF-122, IF-128, IF-133, IF-142 — the seams this module declares (process.md §8; rows of record
in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-102: the carrier's whole read surface, as trace.py imports it — and
    as the spine readers that JOINED it read it rather than each restating the
    vocabulary: acceptance_record, check_trajectory, gen_arch_map,
    plan_coverage, spine_rules, and traj_status through check_trajectory's
    module attribute. SPINE_TABLE maps an id column to its TOML tier table
    (SR-ID -> requirement, LLR-ID -> design, TC-ID -> test) and SPINE_COLUMN
    maps a carrier key to today's column name. rows_from_text(text, id_col,
    carrier) returns {id: row} under those names, or None — never {} — when a
    TOML text does not parse; rows_seq_from_text keeps file order and
    duplicates, so a duplicated id under the CSV fallback still reaches an
    integrity check as two rows. stem(rel) strips the suffix and carriers(rel)
    names both suffixed paths, for an applicability test that has to span the
    cutover commit. resolve(path) returns the live carrier file and
    RAISES when a stem exists under both, rather than resolving by precedence;
    load(path, id_col) returns rows in file order, the shape csv.DictReader
    returns, [] when the registry is absent and SystemExit when it exists and
    will not parse. The `-000` example filter is NOT applied here.

Contract IF-104: check_doc_refs reads the spine through resolve() and load()
    for its Evidence-class pointer scan. resolve() is asked first, so an absent
    tier SKIPs cleanly instead of reporting every pointer in it as dangling;
    load() then hands back the TC and LLR rows under today's column names
    (Evidence, Module, CodeSymbol, TestRefs) whichever carrier is live, and
    raises rather than returning [] on a registry that exists and will not
    parse.

Contract IF-105: check_flows needs id UNIVERSES, not cells. load(path, id_col)
    supplies the SR/LLR/SN/TC keys a runtime-flow diagram's citations are
    validated against — under TOML an id is the table key, so this is the one
    consumer that needs no column vocabulary at all — and
    resolve(path, NEED_CARRIERS) says which need carrier is live, so a
    markdown-era needs registry is still found.

Contract IF-106: gen_okf exports the SR, LLR, TC and IF tiers through load()
    and the need tier through needs_for_root(root), which folds each need onto
    the core four with the `-000` examples dropped and the rows id-sorted.
    resolve(), stem(), CARRIERS and NEED_CARRIERS give each emitted source
    pointer the live carrier's own suffix, so a bundle file names the registry
    that exists rather than the one the migration is heading for.

Contract IF-107: gen_release_checklist groups the SR, TC, LLR and IF rows it
    lists by phase through load(), and reads the need tier through
    folded_needs(). Phase arrives as an int from the TOML carrier and as a
    string from CSV; value_to_cell renders both to the same cell text, so the
    grouping is identical either side of the carrier cutover.

Contract IF-108: plan_briefs reads the system-requirements and interfaces
    registries through load(root / rel, id_col) — the rows a dual-plan planning
    brief embeds VERBATIM. They arrive in file order under today's column names
    under either carrier; an absent registry is [], and one that exists and
    will not parse raises instead of quietly narrowing what the planner is told.

Contract IF-109: agent_loop reads SR and TC rows through load() for two
    purposes at once — the SR Verification cell decides whether a critique
    round is owed, and SR/TC prose is lifted verbatim into the session brief.
    Both take the same rows under the same column names, so a gate decision and
    the brief beside it can never be drawn from different vocabularies.

Contract IF-110: the unified mint reads the LLR, TC, IF, CMP and open-item
    registries through load() to decide what already exists before it places a
    new row; resolve(), stem(), CARRIERS and NEED_CARRIERS name the live
    carrier of each registry it reports on, and SPINE_TABLE names a tier's TOML
    table. This is the READ half of a read-modify-write — the mint also writes
    Status back — so the carrier must answer the read and the write about the
    same file.

Contract IF-111: traj_parse renders the dashboard's need tier from
    needs_for_root(root) — folded onto the core four, `-000` rows dropped,
    id-sorted, markdown emphasis stripped — and its row and off-spine tiers
    from load(root / rel, col). The fold has one home here, so two renderers
    cannot disagree about which needs exist.

Contract IF-112: check_docs holds the root README to the need tier through
    needs_from_text(text) and is_draft_need(need): the Must/Should coverage
    floor reads each need's own priority and status fields rather than a
    table's header text, and resolve(path, NEED_CARRIERS) decides whether there
    is a registry to hold the README to at all. The same module reads the
    open-items registry through resolve() and load() for its deferred-decision
    detector. Existence checking of cited ids stays check_docs' own whole-file
    scrape; only the floor and the open-items read cross this seam.

Contract IF-114: adjudicate_brief lists a red-TC brief's cases from
    load(root / rel, id_col): the TC rows (Verifies, Status, Method, Expected,
    Evidence) and the SR Requirement / LLR Detail text naming the obligation
    each case covers. Every cell it lists is REQUIRED — a row missing one
    refuses rather than rendering a dash. Read-only: nothing on this seam
    writes a registry.

Contract IF-118: the owner decision view reads docs/requirements/open-items
    through resolve() and load(), so it answers whichever carrier is live and
    the rows arrive under today's column names. load() returns [] only when the
    registry is genuinely absent and raises on one that exists and will not
    parse, so an unreadable decision queue can never be published as "0 pending
    decisions".

Contract IF-119: agent_route reads the model registry docs/agents through
    resolve() and rows_seq_from_text(text, id_col, carrier), so a pair row
    arrives under today's column names whichever carrier is live; the CSV
    branch keeps its own declared-header check, which TOML answers as a decode
    failure instead. An unparseable registry is an ERROR here, never an empty
    routing pool. The `# tag-rank:` line the router parses survives as an
    ordinary TOML comment.

Contract IF-120: trunk_step asks the carrier one question — resolve(path):
    which carrier of a registry is live — as the applicability predicate for
    its components and open-items freshness steps. None means the registry is
    absent and the step is inapplicable; a stem present under both carriers
    raises rather than being resolved by precedence.

Contract IF-122: check_need_form scans the need tier through load_needs(path),
    with resolve(path, NEED_CARRIERS) as its presence test, so it reads
    whichever of TOML or legacy markdown is live. Three outcomes stay distinct:
    an unreadable carrier REFUSES loudly (SystemExit), a registry present but
    yielding zero scannable need cells is VACUOUS, and an absent registry is
    the pre-scaffold clean skip.

Contract IF-128: baseline_snapshot resolves and reads every snapshotted
    registry through resolve(), carriers(), stem(), load(), load_needs(),
    CARRIERS and NEED_CARRIERS, so a snapshot root reuses each live resolver
    verbatim, carrier fallback included, and a snapshot taken under one carrier
    and read under another joins on the carrier-STRIPPED stem. Two refusals
    ride this seam: resolve() raises on a stem present under both carriers,
    load() on a file that exists and will not parse.

Contract IF-133: the hats audit worksheet reads the stakeholder-need tier
    through load_needs(), resolve(), NEED_CARRIERS, stem() and folded(), so
    each need arrives under today's column names whichever of TOML or legacy
    markdown is live. An ABSENT registry is [] and the audit prints VACUOUS; a
    carrier that exists and will not parse raises SystemExit, never zero rows.
    The roster read beside it goes to tomllib directly and is no tier of this
    carrier's.

Contract IF-142: gen_components reads all four of its source registries —
    components, system-requirements, low-level-requirements and interfaces —
    through load(), so each answers whichever carrier is live and the rows
    arrive under today's column names. The placement view passes
    keep_examples=False so a scaffold's inert `-000` rows never enter it; the
    "does this repo name any component at all" probe keeps them and filters by
    id itself.

    tier used to spell it `kind = "draft"`, a field that also carried row TYPE.

    A NEED WITH NO `status` IS NOT DRAFT, and that default is deliberate rather
    than incidental: the failure mode this tier can least afford is the one the
    markdown carrier had — a row silently reading as un-drafted floats the
    derived gate UPWARD. Here the absent-key case reads as approved only because
    an absent `status` is caught upstream, as a SCHEMA finding on a required
    key, rather than being invented into a maturity by a reader.

    MATCHED CASE-INSENSITIVELY, the one Status-casing rule the other three tiers
    already follow (`trace.is_drafted`/`is_approved`/`is_founded` all lower the
    cell before comparing; process.md §4). It was an EXACT compare here, and the
    asymmetry failed in the unsafe direction: a need written `status = "drafted"`
    read as approved, floating the derived gate upward — the same silent
    float this docstring's absent-key paragraph exists to prevent, arriving by
    casing instead of by an absent key. Casing is not a maturity, so a
    mis-cased word must not decide one; a word that is not in the vocabulary at
    all is still a finding, and that is `trace.enum_integrity_findings`' job.
