"""Record one observation result — the one writer of `docs/test/observations/`.

    python scripts/record_observation.py --tc TC-### --outcome pass|fail \\
        --by "<who or what observed>" [--expires YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ] [--root .]

WHAT THIS IS (SR-199). An observation test case is one recorded as not
automated: a judgment the harness cannot rerun, like a person reading a render
or a measurement over an adopter's first week. Its result is not written on
the test case, which would mix what the test IS with what it last FOUND and
force the row's re-attestation after every sample. This command writes it as a
record of its own (`kitlib/observation.py`): the case, the outcome, the moment
it was observed (now, in UTC), who or what observed it, when it expires and a
digest of the inputs the case declares it reads, as they stand now.

WHAT IT REFUSES, WRITING NOTHING: a case the registry does not declare, a case
that is automated (its results are the harness's own evidence record), an
outcome outside pass | fail, a missing provenance, a case declaring no usable
lifetime (`max_age`), a case declaring an input outside the repository, and
an expiry that is not canonical UTC, precedes the
observation, or lies further than the case's lifetime after it. With no
`--expires` the record expires one lifetime after the observation. The format
is judged by the record module's own reader and the policy by
`assumption_rules.record_policy_problem`, the rule the traceability check
applies to a record it finds on disk, so the writer and the checker cannot
disagree about what may stand.

WHY THE DIGEST (`inputs_digest`). A result is trusted only while what it judged
is unchanged. Each declared input is folded in declared order as its name, a
NUL and the SHA-256 of its LF-normalized bytes, the fold `kitlib/stage.py`
uses for the stage fingerprint, so a checkout's line endings never make a
result stale. A registry row id among the inputs is digested as that row's
cells as the carrier reads them, so an edit to the row moves the digest and an
edit to its neighbours does not.

AND WHAT JUDGING THEM READS. The checker's rules read no file, so the reads
they need live beside the writer that produces the records:
`evidence_inputs` reads the record files, the digests of what each evidencing
case reads now, the suite's evidence record and each accepted risk's approval
act, once per run, and `trace.py` hands them to the rules.

WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It never opens the test-case registry for writing, so
recording a sample re-opens no approval. And the records' directory is not a
declared stage input and lies outside the release evidence's source surface,
so recording a sample never makes the stage's fingerprint or a release claim
stale.

Contracts: IF-215 — the seam this module declares (process.md §8; row of record
in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-215: the observation writer, as a command and as a call.
    `record_observation.py --tc <id> --outcome pass|fail --by <provenance>
    [--expires <canonical UTC>] [--root <dir>]` writes one record under
    `docs/test/observations/` through `kitlib.observation.write_atomic` and
    exits 0, or prints a line starting `record_observation: REFUSED` to stderr,
    writes nothing and exits nonzero. It reads the test-case registry through
    the carrier and never writes it. `inputs_digest(root, inputs, links=None)`
    is the digest a record's `judged` is compared with to decide whether it is
    current (`links`: the paths git records as links, read from the index when
    not given):
    `""` for no inputs, else `sha256:<hex>` over each input in declared order
    as its name, NUL, the SHA-256 of its LF-normalized bytes (a directory as
    the fold of its files, a missing path or a link as `(absent)`, a link inside
    a directory contributing nothing (`is_link`, the one link predicate), a
    path outside the repository as `(outside the repository)`, never read),
    and newline, with a
    registry row id (`<PREFIX>-<digits>` of any tier a registry holds: the
    carrier's tiers, the needs, the work items and the registry CSVs) digested
    as that row's cells as its reader reads them, `(absent)` when the tier
    holds no such row. And
    `evidence_inputs(root, tcs, das, bifs, framed=None)` is the checker's read of
    everything judging the records needs, returned as the keyword arguments of
    `assumption_rules.observation_evidence_findings`: `records`, `raw_files`,
    `suite_proof`, `digests` and `views`.
