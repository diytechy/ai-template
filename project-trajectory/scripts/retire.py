"""Retire a spine row and leave its record — the one writer of `docs/log.d/retired/`.

    python scripts/retire.py <ID> --reason "<why>" [--successor <ID>] \\
        [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--root .]
    python scripts/retire.py --seed [--root .]

WHAT THIS IS (SR-226). A superseded spine row is DELETED, so the registries
state only what is, and its id is never reused, so a reference to it stays
unambiguous. What deletion loses is the reason: a reader who meets a spent id in
a commit message, a log entry or an archived document cannot tell why it went
or what replaced it. This command deletes the row AND writes its record, one
file per id, `docs/log.d/retired/<ID>.md`, holding the id, the date, the
successor (empty when none) and the reason. Both land as working-tree changes
the caller commits together, so the record rides the deletion's commit.

A RECORD IS FOR LOOKUP, NOT BROWSING. A session that meets a spent id reads that
id's file and nothing else; only the dashboard reads the set. The file per id is
what makes the lookup a path rather than a search, and what keeps the write
conflict-free across parallel branches. The directory sits one level below the
log's fragment drop-box because the trunk step folds and deletes every
top-level `docs/log.d/*.md` and its glob does not recurse.

NO COMMIT HASH IN THE RECORD. A commit cannot contain its own hash, so the
record does not name the deleting commit; `records` reads it from git as the
commit that added the record, and says `unknown` where history cannot answer (an
uncommitted record, a shallow clone, a squashed history).

THE CENSUS. Ids spent before the record began have no record and never will;
`--seed` declares them once, per tier, in `before-the-record.toml` beside the
records, so the check below does not report history nobody can now write. An id
reserved by a lane still building is not spent, so `--exclude` keeps it out;
`--replace` regenerates a census that has not yet landed (the merge that brings
it to trunk, where the true reservations are known), and never one that has.

THE TWO REPORTS, WARN-FIRST (`retirement_findings`, printed by `trace.py` as
advisories, outside every exit code): a spent id with neither a record nor a
place in the census, and a file under the directory whose text differs from its
text as it landed, or that was removed after landing. The second compares git
blobs, not the commits that touched the file, so an edit put back clears itself;
in a shallow clone whose history does not reach a file's landing it says the
file's append-only status is unverifiable rather than passing it.

Contracts: IF-257, IF-258 — the seams this module declares (process.md §8; rows
of record in docs/requirements/interfaces.toml).

Contract IF-257: the retirement records, as files. `docs/log.d/retired/<ID>.md`,
    one per retired SN, SR, LLR or TC row: a `+++` TOML front matter holding
    exactly `id` (the file's own name), `date` (a real YYYY-MM-DD date),
    `successor` (a spine id, or empty) and `reason` (non-blank), and nothing
    after the closing fence; a record is never rewritten.
    `docs/log.d/retired/before-the-record.toml`: one optional key per tier, its
    value the ids spent before the record began as comma-separated numbers and
    `a-b` ranges. `retirement_findings(root)` and `records(root)` are the
    readers' calls: advisory lines for the checker, and `{id, date, successor,
    reason, commit}` per readable record, in tier then number order, for the
    dashboard, `commit` being `unknown` where git cannot name a landing commit
    with a parent.
Contract IF-258: the retirement command's arm and its exit protocol.
    `retire.py <ID> --reason <text> [--successor <ID>] [--date <YYYY-MM-DD>]
    [--root <dir>]` deletes the row's table from its registry and writes its
    record; `retire.py --seed [--exclude ID[,ID...]] [--replace] [--root <dir>]`
    writes the census, an excluded id (`ID` or `ID..N`) never declared, and
    refuses an existing census unless `--replace` is given and it has not
    landed. Exit 0 with one `retire:` line on stdout, or exit 1 with one line
    starting `retire: REFUSED` on stderr and nothing written; argparse's own
    usage errors exit 2.
