# Process Options — the opt-in layers

Companion to [`process.md`](process.md), which carries the load-bearing **core**
every project reads. This file expands the **opt-in layers** that doc summarizes,
each with an **applies-when** so a small project can tell at a glance whether it
needs the layer at all. Nothing here is required for the minimum profile (a
standalone one-module project — see the core doc's header); skip any section whose
applies-when doesn't match your scope.

Section headings mirror the core-doc sections that point here.

## Phased delivery

*Referenced from PROCESS.md §4.* **Applies when** a roadmap ships v1 before
v2/v3; a single-shot deliverable skips it.

A roadmap that ships v1 before v2/v3 needs gates that close *per phase* without
dishonesty. SRs may carry an optional **`Phase`** tag (e.g. `v1`, `v2`; blank =
in scope for every phase). Semantics:

- **Traceability is phase-blind.** Every SR keeps its LLR + TC rows from G2 on,
  whatever its phase — decomposition is cheap and pins the design.
- **The G3 Verified criterion is phase-scoped.** `check.py --gate G3 --phase v1`
  (cumulative for later closures: `--phase v1,v2`) requires Verified only for
  in-scope SRs; out-of-scope SRs are listed in the trace report as
  **phase-deferred** — an explicit, recorded exemption, never a silent skip.
- **G-Release is phase-scoped the same way:** `gen_release_checklist.py --phase v1`
  includes only in-scope human items and the release-tier/manual TCs verifying
  them.
- Later phases re-enter at G1/G2 as requirement increments and close their own
  G3/G-Release with the grown phase list.

## Lifecycle phase

*Referenced from PROCESS.md §4.* **Applies when** install/startup/steady-state
requirements are easy to miss — i.e. most non-trivial products; a pure library
with no runtime lifecycle can leave the tag blank.

Distinct from the delivery `Phase` (which is *when we ship it* — v1/v2), a
requirement also has a **lifecycle phase**: *at what point in the running
product's lifetime must this hold, and how often?* Naming it stops the perennial
miss of writing only steady-state requirements and discovering the install/setup
ones late. Capture it as an **optional `Lifecycle` tag** on an SN/SR (a column or
inline tag, mirroring `Area`; blank = unspecified, treat as **Runtime**) — use the
distinct name `Lifecycle`, never overload the delivery `Phase` column. The default
vocabulary is an **open, project-named set** (extend it per scope like `Area`; it
is **not** a fixed enum):

- **Provision** (ready) — must hold *before the process can run at all*: install,
  dependencies/runtime present, infra provisioned.
- **Startup** (set) — established *once per launch, before it serves*: load +
  validate config, run migrations, open the initial pool, allocate fixed
  resources, readiness probe.
- **Runtime** (go) — steady-state serving, *including recurring acquisition*:
  handle requests, reconnect on drop, per-request alloc, dynamic config reload.

Optional **Shutdown**/**Teardown**, **Upgrade**/**Rollback**, **Recovery** extend
the set when the scope needs them.

- **Discriminate by *when / how often*, not by the word "setup"** — almost
  everything readies *something*. Opening the connection pool *at boot* is Startup;
  reconnecting *mid-operation* is Runtime; a fixed buffer at launch is Startup,
  per-request alloc is Runtime. **One capability legitimately spans phases** — that
  is the payoff: a DB feature yields *provision the DB* (Provision) → *open the
  pool + migrate at boot* (Startup) → *reconnect on drop* (Runtime), and people
  usually write only the Runtime one.
- **Configuration straddles Provision↔Startup, app-dependently.** Config is
  **Provision** when it *must pre-exist* and the app has no way to obtain it at
  launch; it is **Startup** when the app *can* obtain/validate it at launch (a
  first-run wizard, a clear error, or a default fallback). Capture both the
  *definition* (where the config lives) and the *launch behavior when it is
  missing*.
- **Keep one axis.** Dependencies and config are *subjects*, not phases — a
  dependency is required at Provision but used at Runtime; config must exist at
  Provision, is loaded at Startup, may reload at Runtime. The `Lifecycle` tag on
  the concrete requirement already places it; don't add a second "kind" axis.

## §7 boundary notes

*Referenced from PROCESS.md §7.* These three notes draw lines around what the kit
is and isn't; a small project can read the one-line summaries in §7 and come here
only if a boundary is contested. **Applies when** onboarding contributors, wiring
a developer workstation, or deciding whether to add an external measurement or
agent-runtime tool.

**A third toolchain layer — the developer workstation.** The two check layers (§7)
cover what the *project* needs to pass its own gates. A third, often-conflated
concern is what a **human** needs to view, render, edit, and run any of it at all:
a language/runtime, `git`, an **offline** Markdown+Mermaid renderer (e.g. VS
Code's preview, or `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`), and optionally an IDE or a
domain-specific viewer (CAD/image/publication tooling). "No required tools" was
always a claim about the **process** layer (stdlib only); it never meant a human
needs nothing. Naming this third layer resolves the conflation between
"procurement for the product" and "procurement for developing the product."

**The onboarding ladder — Provision-for-development, applied to the act of
developing itself.** A fresh contributor's path to a running checkout mirrors the
§4 lifecycle phases, one level up:

```
Stage 0           →  dev-setup       →  setup          →  check
get git + repo        workstation        product deps      run gates
(pre-clone)           (post-clone)       (venv/tools)       (exists)
```

`Stage 0` and `dev-setup` provision the **developer workstation** above (rare,
once per contributor); `setup` provisions the **product toolchain** (recurs per
clone/CI run); `check` is the **process** floor that already exists. Each rung is
an optional, readable, **consent-first** helper — never a silent or compiled
installer — so a contributor (including a non-code one, whose deliverable is still
a reviewable git change) can go from a bare machine to an editable, testable
checkout without needing prior git literacy.

**Offline-render principle.** Legibility artifacts (the Mermaid diagrams, the
trace HTML map, the code map) must render with **local, offline** tooling — never a
cloud rendering service — the same reason the kit chose Mermaid-in-Markdown (§3) in
the first place. Point contributors at a local renderer; reach for a Kroki/PlantUML
*container* only if a project genuinely outgrows Mermaid.

**The kit generates legibility; it does not score it.** The harness *builds* the
traced spine, the committed code map, and the gates, so a repo scaffolded from this
kit should score well **by construction**. *Measuring* that legibility over time
(AI-readiness, complexity/churn dashboards, doc-navigability scores) is a separate,
deliberately **external** concern — run an **external readiness assessor** (e.g. a
deterministic codebase-scoring tool) as **optional downstream tooling**, never a
kit dependency. This is the same stance the kit takes on `ruff`/`pytest`: it names
the gate; the project picks the tool. Generate here; measure there.

**The kit is a spec; a turnkey agent-runtime harness is a different layer.** This
kit is a stack-agnostic, stdlib, agent-neutral process **spec** you copy into a
repo. A **turnkey agent-runtime harness** — e.g. an `npx`/Node-installed engine
shipping skills/agents/hooks/MCP for one tool, with deterministic verification
gates, model-tiered subagents, and a project-context layer — is a different,
installed **product** a downstream shop may run *in addition*. They **compose** (a
repo scaffolded from this kit can be driven by such a harness) but neither depends
on the other: a runtime harness is optional, tool-specific, downstream tooling,
never a kit dependency. Its "back every verdict with a deterministic gate" stance
is the same one §6 already takes — the philosophical fit is real, the dependency
isn't.

## §9 NFR checklist

*Referenced from PROCESS.md §9.* **Applies when** deciding which non-functional
concerns a project must consider at G1.

**Consideration checklist (a prompt, not a mandate — don't wear a hat the scope
doesn't need).** At G1, consider which categories apply and route each to a home
(anchor: the **ISO/IEC 25010** product-quality model):

- performance efficiency (time, throughput) and resource use (RAM/VRAM, disk);
- reliability / availability / recoverability;
- **security** (authn/authz, data protection, secrets, audit, dependency / supply-chain);
- **observability / operability** (logging, metrics, tracing, health — also the
  prerequisite for *measuring* any of the perf budgets);
- scalability / capacity; compatibility / interoperability;
- portability / installability (incl. artifact size); compliance / legal / licensing;
- safety (cyber-physical); data integrity / durability;
- **cost / economics** (unit/BOM cost, licensing fees, cloud spend; for hardware
  scopes also procurement / supply-chain). Note 25010 is a *software-quality* model
  and omits cost entirely — these systems-engineering categories sit **alongside**
  it, and a quantitative cost budget is just a `PB-###` row (metric-agnostic:
  `Metric=Unit BOM cost, Unit=USD, Direction=lower-better`), compared by
  `check_perf.py` like any RAM budget. No new mechanism.

The kit already covers some — **don't double-prompt**: maintainability (= the core
discipline), usability (= the end-user lens), basic fault tolerance (= the
edge-case table and the SN edge cases), cross-project contracts (= `IF-###`, §8).

## §9 perf comparator

*Referenced from PROCESS.md §9.* **Applies when** a project has captured `PB-###`
budgets it wants tracked over time.

A captured budget is inert until something compares the *measured* number against
it. That comparison answers two distinct questions per metric: **absolute** —
"worse than the budget?" (measured vs `Budget`, per `Direction`) — and
**regression** — "suddenly much worse?" (measured vs a committed baseline, outside
the `Tolerance` band). The work splits along the §7 **process/product** line:
*measuring* a metric is **product** work the project wires (`/usr/bin/time`,
`tracemalloc`, `nvidia-smi`, a size command, `pytest-benchmark`/`hyperfine`),
emitting a `docs/test/perf-metrics.json` map of `PB-ID → number`; *comparing* is
**process** work the kit owns — `check_perf.py`, stdlib-only and metric-agnostic
(arithmetic over JSON). The kit owns the comparator; the project owns the meters.

- **Three artifacts, three reviewability classes (§3):** `performance-budgets.csv`
  is the tracked source of truth; `perf-baseline.json` is a **committed golden**
  updated *deliberately*; `perf-report.md` is a **gitignored composite** (current
  vs baseline vs budget + deltas), regenerated each run and published by CI.
- **Baseline-as-golden protocol.** Accepting a regression = committing a new
  `perf-baseline.json` **in the same PR**, so the number move is explicit and
  reviewed — never silent (the same discipline as the coverage threshold and
  phase-deferred SRs). `check_perf.py --update-baseline` rewrites it from the
  current metrics for exactly that purpose.
- **Warn-first; start with the deterministic metrics (honest-gate rule, §4).** The
  per-row `Gate` decides fail-vs-warn and `Tier` decides *when* a row is in scope:
  gate the **low-noise, deterministic** metrics (artifact/binary size, dependency
  count) at `full`; default **noisy runtime** metrics (latency, peak RAM, VRAM,
  throughput) to `Gate=warn` at `release`, with tolerance bands and same-runner /
  best-of-N measurement. A number that can't be a reliable `Test` gate is
  warn-tracked or `Demonstration`, never faked into a binary gate. A budget with no
  measurement this run is skipped, like a missing tool — absent metrics never fail.

## §10 several modules, one repo

*Referenced from PROCESS.md §10.* **Applies when** a repo grows distinct
sub-systems that still build and release as one (rung 2 of the scale ladder).

**No new machinery, just partition the spine.** A multi-module repo is the *same*
spine, grouped by columns that already exist: the LLR **`Module`** column and the
optional **`Area`** tag on SR/TC (§1 "Domain hats"). Each module is a sub-tree of
`SN→SR→LLR→TC`; where a module needs its own discipline it gets its own **domain
hat** owning that slice (§1 already allows this). The repo still builds, gates, and
releases as a whole.

- **Module-scoped review is a convention over the existing columns, not a new
  flag.** A module owner reviews their slice by filtering the registries on
  `Area`/`Module` (a grep or spreadsheet filter); the **repo-level gate stays the
  source of truth** — `trace.py --strict` still requires **0 orphans across the
  whole repo, seams included**. The kit deliberately ships **no**
  `--module`/`--area` filter on `trace.py`/`check.py`: a per-module gate would
  either hide the cross-module seams (a false "green" masking exactly the
  integration gaps this method wants first-class) or need real machinery to tell a
  legitimate seam from an orphan. The whole-repo gate already spans every module;
  per-module *ownership* is a reading convention, not a gate of its own.
- **Integration TCs for the seams.** A module boundary is where two parts must
  agree, so it gets its **own** TCs — not merely each module's internal unit tests.
  These are integration/system-level, usually `Tier=Full` or `Release` (§4 "Test
  tiers"), so the seam is a tested contract rather than an untested gap between two
  individually-green modules.
- **`IF-###` applies *within* a repo, too.** The interface registry (§8) is not
  only for separate repos: two modules in one repo that share a contract record it
  as an `IF-###`, with the counterpart naming the **other module** instead of
  another repo and both rows living in the one `interfaces.csv`. Same
  direction/owner/version/stability discipline, same "one contract, one home,
  backed by a test" rule — applied to the internal seam, with no cross-repo build
  machinery.
