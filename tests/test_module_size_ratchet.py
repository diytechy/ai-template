"""The no-new-monolith ratchet — repo-review-2026-07-22 H-2 (growth sensor).

The per-function complexity ratchet (test_complexity_ratchet.py) freezes how
hard any one function is to read. This is its file-scale sibling: it freezes how
large the kit's biggest scripts are, so the six coordinators the 2026-07-22 deep
review flagged as "beyond maintainable review scale" cannot silently grow while
the real decomposition (WI-280) is deferred.

Any kit script whose line count exceeds THRESHOLD must have an EXACT baseline
entry below. The census may only tighten by default:

- A baselined module grew, or a NEW module crossed THRESHOLD without a baseline:
  the fix is DECOMPOSITION (WI-280), not a baseline bump. A deliberate bump is a
  reviewed baseline edit whose reason lands in the WI/session log — never a
  drive-by. Moving lines into a new module is exactly the intended escape hatch:
  the new module stays under THRESHOLD (or earns its own reviewed baseline) and
  the shrunk one re-stamps downward.
- A module improved below its baseline (or dropped under THRESHOLD, or was
  renamed/removed): re-stamp its entry downward — or delete it — in the same
  commit, so the ratchet only ever tightens.

This is a growth SENSOR, not an approval of the current sizes. WI-280 is the
scoped decomposition that pays this debt down; every entry here is active
architectural debt, not a target.
