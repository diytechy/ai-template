# Spine authoring in a lane

Use the mode table and parent rule in [../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md), "Three ways a
spine grows". The tier questions in §1–§3 apply in both lane modes.

## In a lane, released rungs: one change set, authored and judged whole

Why closed and whole: an open set converges one missing link per sitting (a
child returned for want of a parent, then a TC for an arm its LLR states).

- **Name the anchor first.** This is the approved need or requirement the
  change hangs from. An additional obligation derived through a lens needs a
  labelled derived SR (§2(c)); a missing stakeholder outcome needs an SN
  proposal, not an unrelated parent.
- **Author the subtree in one pass.** Include every new and amended row from
  the anchor down (SRs, LLRs, TCs and interface rows) and each approved row
  whose text the change makes untrue. New rows stay `Drafted`; interface rows
  carry no approval status. Leave existing statuses unchanged while authoring.
- **Map the arms.** For each LLR, list what it states (each outcome, refusal
  and exemption) and the TC clause that verifies each. Structural checks do
  not establish this coverage.
- **Write the row text against settled code.** While the code is still
  changing, keep only the trace fields current (`Implements:`, LLR `Module`
  and symbols, TC `Evidence`) and list the row-text changes the code implies.
  Write and judge them once the code stops moving: each text change made
  after a sitting owes another (`docs/process.md` §4, "sequence
  requirement-text work *into* an open window"). A Done-when edit is the
  exception: it holds the lane's next build until its exact text is blessed.
- **Reconcile before judgement.** Check the whole set against the code and
  its trace fields before the sitting.
- **Close the edges before the sitting.**
  - Each row's parent is in the set or already approved.
  - Each TC names its LLR and that LLR's SR.
  - Each interface row the change adds or alters has a citing TC.
  - `scripts/trace.py --strict-integrity` and
    `scripts/check_trajectory.py --strict` pass. They check the whole repo,
    so judge arm coverage separately using the map.
- **Judge it in one sitting, top-down.** One combined adjudication (the
  `combined` brief) takes the set's amendments, first approvals and any
  Done-when change together. Keep each kind's verdict lines in its own section
  of one verdict file; commit it before each kind's act, taken in its own
  reviewed commit. Read parents before children and approve parents first.
  If a parent is returned, withhold its children's approval and distinguish
  chain-only returns from defects in the children's own text.

## In a lane, a held rung: split the set at the dial

Use the same authoring and closure checks, then split approval authority:

- **Held first drafts stay `Drafted`.** Include them as chain evidence; their
  approval stays with the owner through the approval brief.
- **Judge held amendments for CLARITY or MEANING.** CLARITY means the obligation
  is unchanged. Only an independent sitting that rules the amendment CLARITY
  in its verdict may re-attest it; name that file in the act's `--verdict`.
  A MEANING change awaits the owner. Leave existing statuses unchanged.
- **Released children wait for their held parent.** They may be judged in the
  same sitting, but approved only after the parent is approved for its current
  text.

If the snapshot refuses because another approved row in the registry still
drifts, leave it unanchored and report the refusal; do not widen the act to
include text you have not judged (`docs/process.md` §4; amendment brief).
